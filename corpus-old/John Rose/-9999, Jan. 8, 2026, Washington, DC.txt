Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Utah for yielding  and for arranging this Special Order.

It is with a heavy heart that I rise today to honor my friend and  colleague, Representative Doug LaMalfa. He was a true champion for  rural America and a staunch supporter of our Nation's farmers.

I often describe Doug as a gentle giant. You will hear others say  that. He was tall and broad enough for me to assume I better not mess  with this guy. His impact on Washington is just as giant. However, I  suspect many of us will remember his gentle side the most.

Members of this body, including myself, often counted on Doug's  lighthearted comments, for his moments of levity. Doug always handled  himself the way we would all aspire to. He spoke calmly, with  conviction, and with his constituents top of mind.

Representative LaMalfa fought hard for the issues that mattered to  California's First Congressional District and for farmers, broadly,  across our country. As an eighth-generation Tennessee farmer, I found  it easy to relate to Doug, a proud fourth-generation rice farmer.

Throughout our service on the House Ag Committee, I appreciated  having a partner with similar perspective and values as we worked to  set ag policy. I learned quickly to trust his instincts. I will miss  that.

Doug and I were avid competitors. I will miss that as well. Long  before I served with him on the Ag Committee, I came to consider him a  very worthy opponent, and I will miss those days very dearly as I move  forward.

I will close by extending my condolences to his family, including his  wife and children. While Doug will be missed here, I can only imagine  how he will be missed at home. We will be praying for them in the days  ahead.
