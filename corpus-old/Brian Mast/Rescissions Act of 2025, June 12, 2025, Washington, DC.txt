Rescissions Act of 2025


Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I could use my minute for a number of things,  but I think I am going to use it now to apologize to all of you in the  gallery.

I am sorry. You just literally had to listen to somebody lying to all  of you directly.

How many times did she say the word ``billionaire''?

How many times did she say that we are trying to do something to  enrich billionaires?

That is not taking place at all. We are cutting waste, fraud, and  abuse.

Billions of dollars have gone to a Canadian lesbian justice  foundation, transgender sex workers networks in Nepal, and a whole list  of things. I would say that among the definition of things that we  could do to eliminate those programs would be the definition of saving  the American taxpayer money.

I am going to leave it at that.

They expect you to believe what they say and not believe what you can  see with your own eyes.

Let the American people be the judge of whether that is saving you  money or whether that is enriching billionaires.

We want to end programs like LGBTQI in the Caribbean, the Balkans,  and Uganda, and all the dollars that we put into trying to support  those programs that are waste, fraud, and abuse. Our American tax  dollars should not be spent in that way.

I am sorry that they are lying to you in this way, but we are going  to work through all this and work to save you all money.

I am sorry that you are all being lied to, but you are going to  expect to hear more.
