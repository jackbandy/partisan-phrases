Recognizing Place of Hope


Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Place of Hope on the  occasion of its 25th anniversary of serving children and families in  crisis across Florida's 21st Congressional District.

Founded on faith, Place of Hope has dedicated its mission to breaking  cycles of abuse, poverty, and homelessness. With five campuses across  Palm Beach and Martin Counties, they provide critical services like  neighborhood foster care, maternity care, independent living programs,  human trafficking prevention, and family outreach.

Over the past 25 years, Place of Hope has served more than 150,000  children, youth, and families--offering safe homes, educational  opportunities, and pathways to independence. Their programs keep  siblings together, provide refuge for trafficking survivors, and  distribute more than two million pounds of food to families in crisis.

I commend the Founding CEO, Charles L. Bender, III, the dedicated  staff, volunteers, and supporters who have all made this milestone  possible. Their work exemplifies the power of faith and service in  changing lives. May they have an even greater impact on our  communities' families in the years to come.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Place  of Hope for 25 years of service and lifesaving impact.
