Recognizing Jennifer and Stephanie Han


Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jennifer and  Stephanie Han, two remarkably accomplished sisters from El Paso whose  dedication and success in women's boxing has inspired all of us.

Jennifer Han, former IBF world featherweight champion and soon-to-be  member of the International Women's Boxing Hall of Fame, has paved the  way for women in the sport, making her one of the most accomplished  female boxers in the country and the world. She now lives a quiet life  as a mother and trainer at a local gym where she teaches youth  programs.

Her sister, Stephanie Han, has built her own legacy in boxing with an  undefeated record. She earned this year's WBA lightweight title by way  of knockout in the first round in under 2 minutes. She is ranked as  number two in the world, and beyond her success in the sport, she is a  dedicated mother, wife, and officer with the El Paso Police Department  where she dedicates herself to public service.

We are so proud of both of them.
