International Human Rights Day


Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on International  Human Rights Day, which marks the adoption of the Universal Declaration  of Human Rights in 1948.

After the atrocities of World War II, world leaders understood that  large-scale abuses do not begin with mass violence. They begin when  governments cut off basic rights, freedoms, and silence their own  people. The declaration was an effort to build a more stable and  predictable world by setting clear rules for how governments should  treat their citizens.

More than seven decades later, we are again seeing election  interference and political repression, attacks on journalists and civil  society, war crimes committed with impunity, and a broader disregard  for basic human rights. One of the clearest examples is Russia's  invasion of Ukraine. To deny Ukrainians the freedom to choose their own  future, Russia has bombed hospitals and kindergartens, executed  civilians, and abducted Ukrainian children in an attempt to erase  Ukrainian culture. And Ukraine is not the only place where the Kremlin  uses coercion to control its neighbors and dictate their political  direction.

Last year, the Georgian Government took unprecedented steps to  silence its citizens and weaken their democratic system. It passed  repressive laws. It walked away from Georgia's constitutional promise  to join the Euro-Atlantic community. And it cracked down on civil  society and imprisoned political opposition, moves that align squarely  with Moscow's interests. Leaders in Georgian civil society--including  Nino Dolidze, the recipient of the National Democratic Institute's  democracy award--have worked at great personal risk to defend those  basic rights. Their fight is part of a larger global struggle.

From Eastern Europe to Latin American and Southeast Asia, the pattern  is the same: When authoritarian leaders feel threatened, they silence  critics, shut down independent groups and dismantle the checks meant to  hold them accountable. And the regimes that do this are the same ones  that threaten regional stability and our own security, which is why  supporting democratic movements and civil society abroad remains  squarely in America's interests.

This administration's funding cuts for democracy and election  observation programs move us in the wrong direction. And directives  telling U.S. personnel to avoid speaking publicly about how elections  are run overseas only make it harder to call out abuses when they  occur. The United States should not be stepping back; we should be  stepping up.

Few leaders understood these stakes more clearly than Madeleine  Albright. At her confirmation hearing for Secretary of State, she said,  ``Democratic  progress must be sustained as it was built, by American leadership. And  our leadership must be sustained if our interests are to be protected  around the world. Do not doubt: those interests are not geopolitical  abstractions, they are real.''

I was reminded of that during a visit to Kosovo a few years ago.  While standing at Secretary Albright's statue, an older man approached  to thank us for her leadership and for the U.S. role in ending the war  there. It was a clear reminder that when the United States stands with  people fighting for basic rights, it makes a difference.

On this Human Rights Day, we should take that lesson seriously.  Supporting democracies and independent civic groups makes America  safer. That takes U.S. leadership. So I urge my colleagues to back  steady funding, credible election observation, and the resolve to call  out abuses when they occur.
