Welcoming Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew


Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, today I rise to join my constituents in  New Hampshire, including those at the St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox  Church of Manchester and the St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church of  Portsmouth, in welcoming His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch  Bartholomew on the occasion of his visit to the United States from  September 15 to 17, 2025.

On behalf of the State of New Hampshire, I recognize His All- Holiness' efforts to strengthen humanity's relationship with nature  through an approach that combines science and spirituality, for which  he has been awarded the 2025 Templeton Prize.

His All-Holiness inspires millions of Orthodox Christians around the  world as well those beyond the Orthodox Catholic Church. Through his  engagement with Catholics, Lutherans, Baptists, Muslims, and Jews, he  has built bridges in advancement of a more peaceful and interconnected  world.

I am personally grateful for his continued prayers on behalf of the  people of Ukraine, which provide hope and strength to the Ukrainian  people as they defend their nation. His support for Ukraine provides a  light in the dark to Ukraine's many faithful Orthodox Christians amidst  one of the most trying periods in Ukrainian history.

As the 270th successor to the Apostle Andrew, His All-Holiness has  been a voice for those without a voice and a champion of peace, love,  and salvation. Deeply connected to the Sacred Theological School of  Halki through his studies and teachings, he continues to provide  guidance to the faithful.

On a per capita basis, New Hampshire is proud to host the largest  Greek diaspora in the United States. On behalf of the Granite State, I  wish him well on his visit to the United States and look forward to  continued engagement between His All-Holiness and the people of the  United States.
