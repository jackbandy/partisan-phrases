Apache County and Navajo County Conveyance Act of 2025


Mr. CRANE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in favor of my bill,  the Apache County and Navajo County Conveyance Act of 2025.

This legislation would transfer Federal land currently under the  purview of the U.S. Forest Service to Navajo and Apache Counties.

For more than a decade, the communities of Pinedale and Alpine have  struggled to find appropriate cemetery space to meet the needs of  family members wishing to enter and pay respects to their loved ones.

My bill would expand the land adjacent to the Alpine Community  Cemetery, preventing the need for members of the community to be laid  to rest in a distant cemetery.

These communities have storied histories dating back to the pioneers,  and they deserve to lay their loved ones to rest in a place that means  so much to them.

My primary objective as a public official is to remain principled and  effective for the district that I represent, ensuring that rural  communities are not forgotten by the Federal Government.

Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Chairman Westerman, Navajo County  Supervisor Seymore, and Apache County Supervisor Nelson, and also my  colleagues on the other side for their support and their leadership.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support this sensible solution.
