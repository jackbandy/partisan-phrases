Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, the month we are in, the month of October,  is Domestic Violence Awareness Month--the time that we should recognize  the devastating impact domestic violence continues to have on  individuals, families, and communities across our States and the  Nation.

The issue of domestic violence often remains hidden behind closed  doors. It is a reality that affects millions of Americans every year,  both in communities large and small, urban and rural, and unfortunately  across my own home State of Kansas.

While national headlines may briefly focus attention on this issue  when a tragedy occurs or a public figure is involved, our commitment to  ending abuse must remain constant after the news cycle.

The statistics regarding domestic violence are staggering. Domestic  violence that occurs between partners--girlfriends and boyfriends,  husbands and wives--affects more than 12 million--12 million--people  every year. On a typical day, every 9 seconds, a woman is assaulted in  the United States. In Kansas, law enforcement reports nearly 22,000  incidents of domestic violence annually. These aren't statistics from  faraway places; they reflect our friends, neighbors, coworkers, and  family members.

We have a responsibility to bring hope to those who feel afraid to  speak out. I want to recognize the Kansans who dedicate their lives to  that mission, those who work and volunteer in shelters, crisis centers,  advocacy organizations, and law enforcement across the country. Their  compassion and courage make a difference every single day.

In Iola, KS, Hope Unlimited provides a lifeline for victims seeking  safety and support. Working hand in hand with local law enforcement and  first responders, Hope Unlimited's advocates and trained volunteers  deliver services for victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and  human trafficking. Their coordinated response models ensure survivors  are met with care the moment they reach out.

We know that when victims are turned away or forced to travel long  distances for help, 90 percent return to their abuser--a reminder why  access to local support is critical.

Across Kansas, similar organizations, like Safehome in Johnson  County, StepStone in Wichita, and the Crisis Center, Inc., in  Manhattan, are helping survivors rebuild their lives with dignity and  safety.

What happens in Washington, DC, matters, but we change the world one  person--in fact, one soul--at a time. In communities across Kansas and  across America, that is exactly what is happening.

The Federal Government plays a meaningful role in supporting these  efforts. Through programs like the legal assistance for victims grant,  Kansans have access to legal representation that helps survivors  navigate the justice system and reclaim their sense of safety and  stability.

The work is far from over. Domestic violence is more than a law  enforcement or a policy issue; each of us can and must play a role in  ending it. This month and every month, let us recommit ourselves to  breaking the cycle of abuse. Let's do our part to speak out against  violence in all its forms and to stand with those who have been  silenced for too long. Let's raise awareness of this silent and  devastating issue and bring hope to those who need it most.
