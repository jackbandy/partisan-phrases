Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, first of all, I would like to compliment  the majority leader, the Senator from South Dakota, for his continued  efforts to have the Senate return to the days in which we were the  greatest deliberative legislative body, assuming that was ever true. It  is hard to find evidence that it is true today. And, certainly, a basic  function of the Congress is to do appropriations bills.

I have heard a number of my colleagues, particularly Democratic  colleagues, complain about the appropriations efforts by the White  House, by the administration. They remind us that the Constitution puts  in the prerogative, it is the Congress that appropriates. Here we are  trying to appropriate, to do our constitutional duties, and the vast  majority of Democrats stand in the way on one of the most important  appropriations bills that we could consider, the Defense appropriations  bills.

Our adversaries, our allies, again, wait and watch for signals that  the United States of America is the country it needs to be to defend  freedom and liberty around the world. As of today, we are incapable of  funding our Department of Defense.

I highlighted yesterday in remarks that those who had come to the  floor and worried and complained about the  military men and women during the shutdown who are not receiving  compensation for their service to our Nation, the most straightforward  way to make certain that those who serve are compensated is to pass the  Defense appropriations bills authorizing and appropriating the money to  make those payments. Yet, today, there are those who stood in the path  to prevent that from happening.
