Veterans' Compensation Cost-Of-Living Adjustment Act of 2025


Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I have introduced legislation, as is  introduced on an annual basis. We have done so again this year to make  certain that the rate of disability compensation and other financial  benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs for veterans and  military survivors keeps pace with the rate of inflation.

The annual Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of  2025 will increase certain VA benefits by 2.8 percent, including  disability compensation, clothing allowances, and dependency and  indemnity compensation for surviving spouses and children. That is to  better reflect the changes in the everyday cost of living and align  with the annual benefit increase by the Social Security Administration.

This adjustment allows veterans and their families to have the peace  of mind of knowing that their VA benefits will keep up with our  Nation's economy and that the VA can continue delivering support for  those who have served while alleviating the stress of financial  uncertainty due to circumstances that are out of their control.

In addition to the Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act, the Senate  Committee on Veterans' Affairs has also reported out Senator Rosen's-- the Senator from Nevada--Lactation Spaces for Veteran Moms Act, which  would make certain that each VA medical center has an appropriate space  for veteran moms to pump or to breastfeed.

Women veterans are the fastest growing patient demographic, and we  must make certain that VA facilities can meet their needs.

Mr. President, I, therefore, ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 202, S. 2392.
