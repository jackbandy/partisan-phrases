Providing for Consideration of H.R. Streamlining Procurement for Effective Execution and Delivery and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year and Providing for Consideration of H.R. Stop Illegal Entry Act of 2025


Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on my amendments to  the National Defense Authorization Act.

This administration has made their military plan clear: weaponize our  troops against the people and use our military installations to advance  their immigration agenda.

As plans to house undocumented immigrants on military bases continue,  base leadership must be informed about everyone that is coming onto the  base and if their treatment and detention meets well-established  Federal standards.

My amendments would require the Department of Homeland Security to  create a registry of all undocumented immigrants held at DOD facilities  and require a joint DOD-DHS report to the Congress on the use of force  and compliance with Federal detention standards, standards designed to  ensure humane treatment.

Unfortunately, these amendments aren't just needed but necessary  given the reports of DHS violating the rights of undocumented  immigrants and those with legal status at detention facilities all  across our country. We must have accountability, and if this  administration plans to use our military installations as detention  facilities, then DOD must play a role in curbing DHS' inhumane tactics.

I ask all my colleagues to support these amendments.

Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.
