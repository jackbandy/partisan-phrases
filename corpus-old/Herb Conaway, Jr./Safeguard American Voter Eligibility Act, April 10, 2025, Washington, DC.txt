Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act


Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the  SAVE Act. While everyday Americans are struggling from the fallout of  Trump's disastrous tariff policies, Republicans are pushing through a  bill that strips Americans' constitutional right to vote, a vote that  was hard won and for which many died.

They claim the SAVE Act is intended to prevent undocumented  immigrants from voting, but it is already illegal for them to vote, and  it is extremely rare.

In reality, the SAVE Act makes it harder for Americans, especially  women and people of color, to participate in our elections. We have  seen these tactics before, creating barriers to the ballot box to  suppress the vote, and yet Republicans continue to find ways to  undermine democracy.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to take a hard look in the mirror  and ask themselves: Do you want to stand on the side of voter  suppression or do you want to stand on the side of democracy? I choose  democracy and will vote ``no'' on this dangerous anti-American bill.
