Sba Fraud Enforcement Extension Act


Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4495, the  SBA Fraud Enforcement Extension Act. I am the co-lead on this  legislation, along with my friend, colleague, and fellow Air Force  veteran, Representative Downing.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 30 million small businesses  were negatively impacted. The Federal Government took action to ensure  that an unprecedented amount of money flowed into small businesses in  the form of grants and loans in order to help them stay afloat.

Over the course of 18 months, the SBA administered four major  programs, which delivered 22.1 million loans and $1.2 trillion in  grants. Although these loans did provide much-needed relief to numerous  small businesses throughout the United States, there were many who  illegally obtained these loans.

The SBA issued a report titled: ``Protecting the Integrity of the  Pandemic Relief Programs.'' It states that there are estimates that $36  billion of the $1.2 trillion in pandemic relief emergency funds were  obtained illegally.

H.R. 4495 would extend the civil and criminal statute of limitations  for violations of, or conspiracy to violate, fraud related to the  Shuttered Venue Operators Grant and the Restaurant Revitalization Fund.

To ensure small businesses can receive the benefits they deserve, it  is important that the SBA is properly funded and staffed. I am  concerned that the cut in the SBA's workforce by 43 percent will impede  the SBA's ability to recover the improper and illegally obtained  payments.

Mr. Speaker, having said that, I urge all of my colleagues to support  this very important legislation. I thank my colleague, Representative  Downing, for allowing me to lead this important piece of legislation  with him.
