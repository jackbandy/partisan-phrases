Mourning Devastating Tragedy in Santo Domingo


Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise on  the floor today as people across the Dominican diaspora are united in  solidarity to mourn the devastating tragedy in Santo Domingo, Dominican  Republic.

Following the collapse of a roof at a nightclub, 124 individuals lost  their lives and 150 are injured, and many are still missing. I express  my deepest condolences to the families of each of the victims and  embrace them during this time of hurt. We stand in solidarity with all  of those who have been affected by this heartbreaking event. Their pain  is our pain, and their grief is felt by all who hear them. In this  moment of profound sorrow, our thoughts and prayers are with the  victims and their families.

``May peace be with the lost souls of this tragedy, and may their  loved ones forever cherish the memories they have of each of them.''  ``Estamos con ustedes, nuestras oraciones estan en nuestros corazones  con ustedes. Dios les bendiga.''
