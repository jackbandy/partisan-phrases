Holding Ice Accountable


Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, Federal immigration agents are out of  control.

President Trump and Secretary Noem have turned ICE and border patrol  into masked paramilitary forces that are terrorizing our neighborhoods.  They are operating outside the law, terrorizing our communities,  violating court orders, and shooting and killing immigrants and  American citizens alike.

I cosponsored Articles of Impeachment against Kristi Noem, and I  voted against funding the Department of Homeland Security to hold this  administration accountable.

ICE must be defunded and dismantled. I am working to take the $75  billion that Republicans gave to ICE in the big, bad bill and invest  the money where it belongs, which is in expanded healthcare and  affordable housing. Every taxpayer dollar is better spent doing  virtually anything other than funding this brutality.

Mr. Speaker, I won't stop fighting until the families in Denver and  across the country are safe from these thugs.
