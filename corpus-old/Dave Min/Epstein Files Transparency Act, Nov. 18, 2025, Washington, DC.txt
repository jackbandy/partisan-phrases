Epstein Files Transparency Act


Mr. MIN. Mr. Speaker, I want to remind my colleagues we are all here  voting on the bill because President Trump, who has the power to  release the Epstein files at any time, has refused to do so. He called  this a hoax.

We are here because Speaker   Mike Johnson and President Trump have  gone to extraordinary lengths to try to kill and delay the discharge  petition, including refusing to seat Adelita Grijalva for over 40 days  and threatening House Republicans who signed on.

Several of my Republican colleagues have accused us who support  justice here of having Trump derangement syndrome. They suffer from  something much worse, which is pedophile protection syndrome.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to stop protecting pedophiles.  Release the Epstein files. The victims deserve justice.
