Teacher Appreciation Week


Mr. MIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Tracy Havens, a second  grade teacher at Hicks Canyon Elementary School in my district. Tracy  has taught our kids in Irvine for the past 20 years and had the honor  recently of being 1 of 6 educators out of 20,000 across Orange County  to be selected as Orange County Teacher of the Year.

Tracy is known for her outstanding ability to build a positive  classroom culture and to find creative ways to engage her students.  Tracy goes above and beyond outside of the classroom, as well. She  mentors teacher candidates and serves as a lead math model for her  district while also helping her students leave their mark through  community initiatives.

Teachers like Tracy inspire us all and are the foundation of the  American Dream.

As a product of California public schools myself, the father of three  young kids in California public schools, and a former educator, I know  how important public education is for economic advancement.

Dedicated teachers like Tracy who go the extra mile for their  students are the key to a good public education.

I congratulate Tracy on earning Teacher of the Year, and I thank the  thousands of teachers across Orange County for their tireless work for  lifting up future generations.
