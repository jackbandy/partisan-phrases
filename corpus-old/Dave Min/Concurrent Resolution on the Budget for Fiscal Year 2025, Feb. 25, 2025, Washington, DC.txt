Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025


Mr. MIN. Madam Chair, I rise today in opposition to the disastrous  GOP budget resolution.

This bill seeks to cut $3 trillion in spending, supposedly by  targeting waste and fraud, but the entire domestic discretionary budget  is only $917 billion, and that simply doesn't add up. There is only one  way to get to $3 trillion in cuts, and that is to slash lifeline  programs, including nearly $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid.

Under the GOP budget, over 136,000 of my constituents would lose  their healthcare, including over 42,000 children. This budget would  also take food away from hungry children and deny healthcare to sick  veterans.

Why are House Republicans pushing such an immoral and cruel agenda?

It is not to reduce our deficits. In fact, their budget adds nearly  $1.6 trillion a year to our debt.

No, it is to pass tax cuts for billionaires and foreign investors. In  fact, over $350 billion of these same tax cuts went to foreign  investors over the last 10 years.

Let's be clear: If this budget passes, kids are going to go to bed  hungry so that we can give more money to Elon Musk and investors from  Saudi Arabia, China, and Russia. This is immoral. It is wrong.

Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this horrible budget  measure.
