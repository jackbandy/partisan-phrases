Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2026


Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Chair, while I am supportive of provisions in the  minibus that would fund the Departments of Labor, Health and Human  Services, Education, Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development,  especially those pertaining to healthcare, I cannot in good conscience  endorse a spending bill that continues to explode our Defense budget.  President Trump has already shown that he is willing to use the  military against American citizens. He is also pursuing foreign  entanglements around the globe, and I will not write him a blank check  to potentially invade other countries or pit America's military against  our allies.
