Doe and Usda Interagency Research Act


Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1326, the  ``DOE and USDA Interagency Research Act'' which I was proud to  introduce alongside my colleague and friend, the gentleman from  Oklahoma, Mr. Lucas.

H.R. 1326 is a bipartisan bill that would authorize cross-cutting and  collaborative research and development between the Department of Energy  and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Together these agencies can  leverage their incredible capabilities to address some of our multi- disciplinary research challenges in crop science, biofuels, carbon  storage, and precision agriculture technologies.

Codifying the partnership between these agencies would be a testament  to our commitment to these communities, particularly rural America, and  our climate.

The Science, Space, and Technology Committee generated substantial  momentum through the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, which included  research support towards agriculture productivity improvement goals.  The DOE and USDA Interagency Research Act would sustain and strengthen  this momentum in its entirety, by empowering deeper collaboration  between these two agencies, enabling our research and agriculture  communities to fully utilize the opportunities presented by a broad  range of new emerging technologies.

With this, I encourage all my colleagues to support this bill.
