Greenlighting Growth Act


Mr. HARIDOPOLOS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership  on this and for the opportunity to present today.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support to ask my colleagues to support  H.R. 3343, the Greenlighting Growth Act, a bill which I introduced with  the subcommittee chair, Ms. Wagner.

This bill will make business easier for small companies right here in  America. That is something we all agree on. Too often, regulations make  it harder than it should be, especially for entrepreneurs and emerging  businesses trying to make the next step.

In 2012, Congress worked to fix that problem, passing the JOBS Act to  create a more affordable path for smaller companies to go public, raise  capital, and fuel the next wave of American innovation, but there is a  problem. After going public, these same companies can get hit with  extra paperwork if they try to grow through acquisitions.

The current law undermines the incentives that the JOBS Act set up,  so we look to change it with H.R. 3343. The bill fixes the problem and  keeps the rule simple and consistent so that small companies can focus  on growing, not growing government paperwork. That means more companies  will go  public, raise capital, grow, and create jobs.

That was the goal of the JOBS Act, and that is what this bill will  accomplish. Small businesses shouldn't be punished for success. They  should be encouraged to grow, build, hire, and do that right here in  the good old USA.

This is a simple, targeted fix with a big impact. It cuts red tape  and keeps America's capital markets open and accessible for the next  generation of job creators.

Let's green-light growth. Let's pass this bill and keep America's  strong economy.

Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R.  3343.
