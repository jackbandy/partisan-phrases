Recognizing Keith Vanburen


Mr. HARIDOPOLOS. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize a valued  member of my staff and a true American hero, Mr. Keith VanBuren.

Keith's service in the United States Army reflects the very best of  sacrifice and devotion to our Nation. While deployed in Afghanistan,  Keith was severely wounded when his vehicle was struck by an IED in  Logar Province. For his bravery, he was awarded the Purple Heart, the  Bronze Star Medal, and the Combat Infantryman Badge.

After completing his military service, Keith continued his commitment  to our country. He served on my predecessor's staff, Congressman Bill  Posey, and he still proudly serves now on my staff assisting veterans  and so many people in our community.

Keith recently was elected commander of the Space Coast chapter of  the Military Order of the Purple Heart. In his role, he will continue  the proud tradition of honoring local heroes who have sacrificed in the  line of duty.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Keith and salute him for his courage, his  service, and his unwavering dedication to our State, our Nation, and  our district.
