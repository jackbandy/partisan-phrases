Recognizing Palm Bay Pirates Girls' Basketball Team


Mr. HARIDOPOLOS. Mr. Speaker, it is March Madness. With America  currently fixated on basketball, I recognize today the Palm Bay girls'  basketball team on their recent statewide victory. The team made  history by capturing the State's Class 4A State championship here in  Florida. The Pirates overcame a tough American Heritage squad where  they rallied from a 14-point deficit to win the State title.

Leading the way was Senior Guard Jaida Civil, a University of  Tennessee commit and McDonald's All American, who grabbed 9 rebounds  and scored 20 points.

The entire team made critical contributions, showing their depth and  the unity of this team. The championship caps off a season where the  Pirates won by an average of 57 points.

I congratulate the entire Palm Bay Pirates team. They have made our  entire community proud.
