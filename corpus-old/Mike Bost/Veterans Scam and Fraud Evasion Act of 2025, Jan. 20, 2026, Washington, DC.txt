Mr. BOST.   1663, as amended.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1663, as amended,  offered by Representative Calvert from California.

This bill would protect veterans from scams and fraud that may target  the benefits they earned through service. Too many veterans, along with  their families, caregivers, and survivors, are being hit with savvy  fraud schemes designed to steal personal information, drain bank  accounts, and even redirect VA benefits to bad actors. When these scams  happen, veterans often don't know where to turn inside the Federal  system.

The VSAFE Act would take direct action to fix this issue. This bill  would add dedicated veterans scam and fraud evasion officer positions  at the Department of Veterans Affairs. This would rightfully build up  VA's fraud prevention and response efforts across VA, so this problem  is treated like a real threat, not just an afterthought.

Representative Calvert's bill would also require VA to improve  communications during urgent fraud incidents, so veterans and their  families are not left in the dark while scammers continue to strike. By  building up VA's existing antifraud tools, adding new ones where  necessary, we can combat fraud head-on.

Mr. Speaker, at the end of the day, veterans should never lose their  hard-earned benefits because the system failed to protect them from  criminals. The VSAFE Act should strengthen the accountability, improve  prevention, and give veterans the support and protection they deserve.

This bill takes an important step toward safeguarding veterans and  strengthening trust in the VA system, and I am proud to support it.

Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R.

Someday, I would like to carry on this floor from our committee a  bill that is actually sponsored by a Republican that my colleague can  actually find totally good. We come out here every time, and he finds  all the excuses of why this is bad, this is bad, and this is bad. This  is a really good bill.

Mr. BOST.  I encourage all Members to support this piece of legislation. I  think it is a wonderful piece of legislation. It is way overdue.
