Wishing A Happy Heavenly Birthday to the Honorable Donald Payne, Jr.


Mrs. McIVER. Madam Speaker, I rise to wish a happy heavenly birthday  to my predecessor in representing New Jersey's 10th Congressional  District, the Honorable Donald Payne, Jr.

He served as Newark City Council president and went on to succeed his  father in this body.

Donald M. Payne, Sr., was the first African American elected to New  Jersey's congressional delegation, and his son carried that legacy  while blazing his own path.

A leader on the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,  Mr. Payne secured critical investments that made rail travel in New  Jersey safer and more affordable.

In honor of his legacy that inspires my leadership and shapes my home  district, today I introduced a bill to rename Newark Penn Station in  his honor: The Donald M. Payne, Jr. Transit Center at Newark Penn  Station.

Newark Penn Station is where so many workers start their mornings,  where families reunite, where students, seniors, and commuters pass  through every single day.

When people walk into that station, they should know the name of the  man whose name helped keep it moving.

Happy birthday, Congressman Payne. We miss you.
