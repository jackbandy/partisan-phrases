Secure Rural Schools Reauthorization Act of 2025


Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of New Mexico's Second  Congressional District to celebrate a long-awaited victory for rural  America, the imminent passage of the bipartisan Secure Rural Schools  Reauthorization Act.

I preface my remarks by thanking Representatives LaMalfa and Neguse,  who introduced this bill, and Chairman Thompson and Ranking Member  Craig. We would not be standing here today without their leadership and  outpouring of strong, bipartisan support that we have seen for this  bill both here in Congress and on the ground in our communities.

For decades, SRS has been more than an abstract Federal program. It  has been a promise, a promise that when Federal lands limit local tax  revenue, Congress will stand with rural communities and school  districts so that they continue to provide the basic essential services  that every American family deserves.

Rural communities across the country and in New Mexico know this  story well. In Catron, Grant, Sierra, and Otero Counties in my  district, national forests define our landscape, and they define who we  are. They are the treasures that we value and protect. Yet, those  beautiful lands also mean fewer taxable acres, fewer revenue streams  for public schools, and fewer resources to maintain the roads that our  families travel every day.

For more than 20 years, SRS helped close that gap. It ensured that  public schools could keep teachers in the classroom, that buses could  run safe routes on rural roads, and that county governments could plan  long-term budgets with certainty.

It ensures that children growing up in frontier communities receive  the same shot at a quality education as anyone in major cities in my  district, like Albuquerque or Las Cruces. It ensures that when there  was a medical emergency in the middle of the night, emergency medical  services had the roads that they needed to save lives.

That stability vanished when SRS expired in 2024. Rural counties  across the West, including mine, were forced to make impossible  decisions.

In New Mexico alone, our communities lost more than $9 million in a  single year. That $9 million loss meant school districts had to  consider laying off teachers and reading specialists and cutting back  to a 4-day school week in a place like Quemado because they could no  longer afford to operate a 5-day school week.

County commissions were forced to take a hard look at their budgets,  looking line by line at what vital services they could cut to ensure  their communities could maintain their roads.

This past August, I met with a bipartisan group of county officials,  educators, and Tribal leaders back home to discuss SRS and the need for  reauthorization. Their message didn't  waver: Rural communities needed Congress to act. They needed certainty.  They needed this lifeline to their communities restored.

Today, after months of fighting for reauthorization, we are  delivering on a bipartisan basis. Today, we are sending a clear message  to rural communities across New Mexico and across the country that they  are not invisible, not expendable, and not expected to bear the weight  of this lapse alone.

The Senate has already passed this reauthorization, and I urge my  colleagues to help us finish the job and send the bill to the  President's desk for his signature.

This is the kind of win that New Mexicans sent me to Washington,  D.C., to deliver, and it is worth celebrating.

This legislation represents the best of what Congress can achieve  when we put aside partisanship and focus on the people we serve. It  reflects both Democrats' and Republicans' shared understanding that  rural counties take on an enormous responsibility in managing and  stewarding our national forests, and their kids should not be left  behind because of it.

It is a recognition that public lands benefit our entire Nation, and  the cost of maintaining essential services like schools and roads  should not fall solely on the shoulders of rural families.

For New Mexico's Second Congressional District, this bill means  stability. It means that school districts can retain teachers, hire  staff, and keep programs in place that enrich our children's futures.  It means that our sheriffs, firefighters, and first responders have  reliable funding for the roads and infrastructure that they depend on  when every second counts.

Passing SRS reauthorization also honors the frontier spirit that  defines rural New Mexico. Communities like Silver City, Cloudcroft,  Quemado, and many others throughout New Mexico continue to lead in  forest conservation, outdoor recreation, wildfire resilience, and  natural resource management. They deserve a Federal partner that  matches their commitment, and today, they are getting that.

Mr. Speaker, both New Mexico and I thank my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle who worked tirelessly to bring this legislation to  the finish line. I also thank the local leaders, our county  commissioners, school superintendents, teachers, parents, and  firefighters, just like these folks here in Fence Lake, who raised  their voices and never let this issue slip from their attention.

As this bill is signed into law, I look forward to witnessing the  relief that it will bring across New Mexico in time for Christmas. I  look forward to seeing teachers stay in their classrooms, rural roads  being repaired and maintained, and families in these rural counties  finally receiving the stability that they have been promised but denied  for too long.

Today is a good day for rural America. Today is a good day for New  Mexico.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud to vote in favor of the SRS Reauthorization  Act, and I urge my colleagues to join me in its passage. I reserve the  balance of my time.

Mr. VASQUEZ.  Salinas), my distinguished colleague.

Mr. Speaker, I want to highlight two particularly important projects  in my district that sit in the Gila National Forest and are surrounded  by the rural communities of Glenwood, New Mexico; Quemado; and Reserve.  These are two incredibly important projects that have helped diversify  rural economies and helped support the outdoor recreation economy: the  Catwalk historic trail and the Cosmic Campground.

These two projects on Federal public lands have brought in very  important economic revenue to these communities. They have brought in  tours from all across the country to see the darkest skies in the  country in what is an International Dark Skies Sanctuary and one of the  most breathtaking trails that one can experience in our Nation's first  wilderness.

Regardless, SRS is incredibly important to help ensure that our  schools and our roads continue to function as we expand New Mexico's  outdoor recreation economy.

Mr. Speaker, I do want to thank Chair Westerman for his support of  the Fix Our Forests Act, introducing that bill, and I hope that it does  make it to the Senate.

I think as we talk about the longevity of rural communities and  sustainability of rural communities, we have to have good forest  management and a diversified economy that includes the timber industry,  cattle growing, and outdoor recreation. So much of that depends on the  health of our public lands.

I am encouraged by the bipartisanship shown on this bill today. I  hope we can have more conversations and we can pass SRS out of the  House today so that we can ensure that these rural communities have a  future that is not dependent on Federal funding but that has a  diversified economy that uses our natural resources wisely.

I think we can all recognize what a special moment this is for our  rural communities. These days, Democrats and Republicans don't often  see eye to eye long enough to get a piece of legislation like this all  the way to the President's desk. The fact that we will today shows just  how important we all know it is to stand up for our rural communities.

For New Mexico, this is real money with real impact. Our rural  communities have been missing more than $9 million that should have  been supporting schools, roads, and essential services. I am proud to  be bringing that money back to the families and communities that have  waited for far too long.

I also want to take a moment to recognize some of the incredible New  Mexican advocates who helped make today possible. This is not a full  list, but it is a long one, so bear with me. Our Secure Rural Schools  champions in New Mexico's Second District include: Kayli Ortiz, Amber  Vaughn, Randall Earwood, Charlene Webb, William Hawkins, Kate Fletcher,  Joy Esparsen, David Lackey, and Deborah Mahler. These are the folks who  showed up, spoke out, organized their neighbors, and never let us  forget what was at stake.

I thank every constituent who wrote, called, and shared their stories  with our office. Their advocacy drove much of this effort. Their  persistence is why we are passing this bill into law today.

Again, I thank my Republican colleagues for working on this piece of  legislation with me and other members of the committee.

I am proud of my community. I am grateful for their trust. Once  again, they proved something that we all know back home: Don't mess  with rural New Mexicans.

I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
