Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2026


Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, President Ronald Reagan founded the  National Endowment for Democracy, in 1983, as an independent, nonprofit  foundation with a bipartisan board, and since then, it has been the  main way that the United States has helped to strengthen democratic  institutions around the world.

NED exposes Russian propaganda, counters Chinese Communist Party  censorship, circumvents the Iranian regime's efforts to silence  critics, and highlights corruption and drug trafficking in Venezuela.  And it does all of that for a fraction of a penny on the dollar.

Let's be perfectly clear. Letting authoritarians go unchecked  directly undermines our interests and our safety, and these attacks  against NED, led by a small group of people, have been repeatedly  proven to be lies. It is why the House defeated the same amendment  resoundingly.

I urge my colleagues to vote no.                          Vote on Amendment No. 4241
