Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act


Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose this Republican  charade and to stand up for my neighbors back home who deserve quality  and affordable health coverage. That includes over half a million of my  hardworking neighbors across the Tampa Bay area.

Mr. Speaker, 4.7 Floridians, or one in five who live in the Sunshine  State, are doing everything right. They are entrepreneurs. They are  caregivers.

They are part-time workers and small business owners like Linda  Misener and her husband. Their premiums will go from $288 per month to  over $3,200 per month next year. They cannot afford $39,000 for their  healthcare. They are terrified that they are going to lose everything.

David, who is being treated for pancreatic cancer, is unsure how he  will continue treatments and afford everything else.

It is unconscionable that Republicans are ripping away coverage to  fund their tax breaks for billionaires, the wealthy, and the well- connected. Americans deserve so much better.

Mr. Speaker, defeat this Republican bill. Bring the 3-year bipartisan  extension to the floor now.
