Foreign Adversary Communications Transparency Act


Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. Dingell for yielding  the time, and I thank Chairman Bilirakis for moving the bill forward to  the floor today.

I rise in strong support of H.R. 906, the Foreign Adversary  Communications Transparency Act. This bill would require the Federal  Communications Commission, the FCC, to publish a public list of  entities with ties to foreign adversarial governments, such as China,  Russia, North Korea, and Iran, especially if they have a license or  authorization that is tied to our communications networks.

Along with Representative Wittman, I serve on the bipartisan Select  Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and  the Chinese Communist Party. Last Congress, the committee released a  bipartisan report on maintaining America's economic and national  security interests. The report found that the widespread adoption of  certain People's Republic of China-developed technologies in the United  States poses a significant risk to national security and threatens  long-term U.S. technological competitiveness.

Our committee report recommended that we enact the FACT Act to shine  a light on companies connected to foreign adversarial governments like  the CCP and to ensure greater accountability and transparency in our  critical communications networks.

Our bill passed the House unanimously by voice vote in the last  Congress, but it didn't quite get over the finish line. We really have  no more time to wait, Mr. Speaker. Our adversaries continue to target  our communications systems, so Congress must take steps now to protect  our communications, telecommunications infrastructure and strengthen  our national security to keep Americans safe. I urge a ``yes'' vote on  the bill.
