Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act


Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, Republicans just passed their big, ugly law  that rips Medicaid by nearly a trillion dollars, adds 15 million people  uninsured, and raises costs for everybody. Now, to add insult to  injury, they refuse to extend the Affordable Care Act.

This bill that they want to replace it with is a bamboozle. It is a  hoodwink. It is a scam for the American people. It promotes junk plans  that rip off the American people. It does not cover essential health  benefits. It allows them to discriminate against people with  preexisting conditions, increases out-of-pocket costs, and will lead to  millions more uninsured.
