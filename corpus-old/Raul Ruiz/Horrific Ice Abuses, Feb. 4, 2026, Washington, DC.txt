Horrific Ice Abuses


Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, as a Member of Congress and a physician, I am  outraged and sad about the killings of U.S. citizen and mother, Renee  Nicole Good, who was shot and killed by an ICE agent; and U.S. citizen  and VA ICU nurse, Alex Pretti, who was fatally shot by an ICE agent  during the same enforcement surge in Minneapolis, sparking widespread  protests and intensifying scrutiny of Federal tactics.

Last year was the deadliest year in over 20 years, with over 56  people dying under ICE and CBP custody in detention centers. Reports of  detainees like Luis Beltran Yanez-Cruz, who died in a hospital in my  district after complaining for days of chest pain without receiving the  appropriate urgent care, are concerning and smell of neglect.

The violence and brutality against noncriminal immigrants and U.S.  citizens are not public safety. It is cruelty. That is why Secretary  Noem must be impeached and removed, and there must be transparency and  accountability.

That is why I introduced the Humanitarian Standards for Individuals  in ICE and CBP Custody Act to prevent death and to protect human  dignity.
