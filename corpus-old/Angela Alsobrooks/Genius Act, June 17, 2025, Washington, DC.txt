Genius Act


Ms. ALSOBROOKS. Mr. President, I supported passage of S. 1582, the  GENIUS Act, because it creates new Federal regulations and consumer  protections for payment stablecoins. Specifically, the bill was amended  to explicitly and clearly preserve State consumer protection laws in  the negotiated rule of construction in section 7(f)(4). This was always  the intent of the bill, as evidenced by the public discussion between  Senators of both parties during the March 13, 2025, markup in the  Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. The amended, final  version of the bill includes this negotiated rule of construction to  prevent State consumer protection laws from being preempted, as  intended by the bill's sponsors and supporters.
