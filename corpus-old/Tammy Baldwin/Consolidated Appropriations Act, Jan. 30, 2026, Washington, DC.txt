Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2026


Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to amendment  No. 4272. This amendment would completely eliminate funding for an  office that helps some of the most vulnerable in our country. This  office helps shelter and care for children who are seeking safety. It  makes sure that these children aren't being trafficked. It makes sure  these children aren't stuck in cages in Border Patrol facilities for  extended periods of time. This office also supports refugees who are  victims of torture and human trafficking and who have been admitted to  the United States by this administration, by the Trump administration.

Lastly, I will note that this program and its funding are supported  by President Trump and were passed out of our Appropriations Committee  with near unanimous support.

This amendment is ill-advised, and I urge my colleagues to vote no.
