American Energy Jobs At Risk


Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, in 2017, the United States ranked 14th in the  world for solar panel manufacturing. Today, we are third.

This happened in large part due to Congress providing long-term  certainty for tax incentives to both produce and deploy American-made  energy technologies.

Clearly, this strategy was working, but the Republicans' big, ugly  tax scam is putting hundreds of thousands of American energy jobs at  risk.

The uncertainty caused by this process has already resulted in over  62,000 jobs being lost or threatened. Repealing these tax credits won't  stop people around the world from driving EVs or using solar, but it  all but guarantees they will be using Chinese technologies.

If China is the big winner, American consumers are the big losers. If  these credits are functionally repealed, the average American could see  their utility bills rise by hundreds of dollars per year.

This is a lose-lose. It is bad for people's wallets. It is bad for  building a strong, competitive economy. It sells out current and future  generations to fund tax cuts for billionaires.

Mr. Speaker, I urge the Senate to reject this disgusting abomination.
