Recognizing the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople


Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize The Ecumenical  Patriarch of Constantinople, His All Holiness Bartholomew, who was  recently selected for the revered Templeton Prize by the John Templeton  Foundation. The Foundation recognizes pioneers of scientific and  spiritual insight for their contributions to human well-being and  spiritual prosperity. Previous award recipients include Mother Teresa,  Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and Nelson Mandela. On behalf of New York's  20th Congressional District, I congratulate His All Holiness  Bartholomew on receiving this great honor.

He is the spiritual leader, and the Primus inter Pares--First among  Equals--of Orthodox Christianity worldwide, a Church of 300 million  people. Named as one of the world's most influential people by Time  Magazine, His All Holiness is an exemplary leader who seeks to build  bridges across different religions. He works tirelessly to bring  together Christians, Jews, and Muslims for the purpose of advancing  greater cooperation and mutual understanding. An advocate for peace,  His All Holiness has called for an end to the hostilities between  Ukraine and Russia.

He is known worldwide as the ``Green Patriarch'' as he makes  conscious efforts to support clean air legislation. I feel grateful  that His  All Holiness uses his authority to raise environmental awareness, and  I'm proud to stand beside him to create sustainable future together. On  behalf of my constituents and my colleagues here in Washington, I thank  His All Holiness for his bravery, guidance, and testimony. I hope that  his visit will bring us together in the spirit of service and encourage  us to live with humility, fairness, and compassion.
