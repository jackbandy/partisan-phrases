Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act


Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, as a result, 4 million people will lose their  insurance. Everyone else on an ACA plan will pay more for worse  coverage, while billionaires sit comfortably and enjoy their tax breaks  from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Remember in the summer and fall, when Republicans told us that this  wasn't the right time to negotiate these subsidies over the shutdown,  they said: Don't worry. That doesn't expire until later in the year. We  are working on a plan.

Later is here. What does this Republican plan do to extend the ACA  subsidies? It does nothing. It does absolutely nothing. This is  unacceptable and downright cruel. While I am disappointed that  Republicans refuse to extend this lifeline, I am not surprised. They  had no intention of voting on extending ACA subsidies.

In fact, I heard that Republican leadership told my fellow New York  Republicans that they needed to find a way to pay for the ACA subsidy  extension if they wanted to even have a vote on it.

Playing under the Republicans' new rules, shouldn't this be free, or  does that math only apply for their billionaire buddies and their tax  breaks?

Mr. Speaker, I urge every Member who cares about their constituents  having affordable healthcare to oppose this plan and sign Leader  Jeffries' petition. Do it for the people.
