Horrific Ice Abuses


Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and  Congressional Progressive Caucus for convening this very important  discussion this evening.

Over the past year, the Trump administration has pursued immigration  enforcement actions, actions that are deplorable, inhumane, and,  indeed, deadly.

Last month, in my district in New York's Capital Region, a family of  five, including an 8-month-old who was reportedly a U.S. citizen, was  detained and deported after ICE entered their apartment without-- without--a judicial warrant, a clear violation of the Fourth Amendment.

In December, our Afghan community was repeatedly targeted, including  ICE arresting a father and son after they exited a mosque following  morning prayer. People who fled the Taliban, fearing for their lives  and their families' lives, are now wondering if they will be picked up  next by ICE.

This is not who we are as a nation. We are supposed to uphold the  values of freedom, the values of democracy, and the American Dream.  Instead, the very people who came here in pursuit of that dream are  afraid to attend school, go to their jobs, go to church, and even leave  their homes for fear of being hunted down, detained, and deported.

Nowhere have the effects of ICE's operations been clearer than in  Minneapolis. The murders of Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti, both  U.S. citizens and both shot multiple times by U.S. agents, were  senseless and horrifying. Two people who should be in the arms of their  families today have instead been killed in the streets.

In their brutal and deadly campaign, ICE has lost all public trust  and credibility. This agency as it exists and operates cannot continue.  ICE must be abolished.
