Events This Week


Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Blake for the time.

Mr. Speaker, this week, we honor the brave men and women who wear the  badge, those who serve with courage, professionalism, and heart to keep  our communities safe.

National Police Week is a time to give thanks and to reaffirm our  support for the law enforcement officers, from Utah to D.C., who put  their lives on the line every single day.

These officers aren't just responding to emergencies. They are  neighbors, trusted members of our communities, and our role models.

Today, I also want to honor a fallen hero from my home State of Utah,  Sergeant Bill Hooser of the Santaquin Police Department. Sergeant  Hooser gave his life in the line of duty, and this week his name is  being added to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial here in  our Nation's Capital.

Mr. Speaker, may God bless the Hooser family. May He continue to  comfort them and be with them always. We will never forget Bill's  service or sacrifice.

House Republicans are taking action to support those who serve. This  week we are advancing commonsense legislation that equips, respects,  and protects our law enforcement community.

Mr. Speaker, I thank every officer, every family who has lost a hero  in the line of duty. Their service matters. Their sacrifice will never  be forgotten.

We back the blue. We trust our officers, and we will fight to protect  those who protect us.

God bless our law enforcement community. God bless the Hooser family,  and may God continue to bless our great Nation.
