Defending Education Transparency and Ending Rogue Regimes Engaging in Nefarious Transactions Act


Mr. OWENS. Mr. Chair, imagine our esteemed universities, pillars of  free thought and innovation, quietly channeling millions into  investments linked to the Chinese Communist Party, Russian oligarchs,  or the Iranian regime. While our students learn about democracy and  liberty, their tuition dollars may be funding governments that stand  against these very ideals.

This isn't hypothetical. This is happening. Since 2013, U.S. colleges  and universities have received over $1 billion from Chinese Communist  Party-affiliated sources. In return, we have seen professors silenced,  student groups threatened, and our intellectual property stolen.

At the same time, these institutions, many of which proudly divest  from fossil fuels and boycott Israel, are more than willing to accept  foreign funding from adversaries who seek to undermine our Nation.

The DETERRENT Act is our line in the sand. It demands transparency  and accountability from higher education. If universities are entangled  with foreign adversaries, the American people deserve to know. I am  proud that my Reporting on Investments in Foreign Adversaries, or RIFA,  Act is included in this legislation. The RIFA Act ensures private  colleges and universities disclose whether they are investing their  endowments in hostile nations like China, Russia, Iran, and North  Korea. These financial partnerships should not be hidden from the  public.

For far too long, we have allowed educational institutions to become  conduits for foreign influence. Administrators on the taxpayers' dime  have given repressive regimes easy access to our students, turning  their backs on the very freedoms they claim to uphold. This betrayal  must stop, and I must make it clear that profit over patriotism, profit  over American values, and profit over American culture is traitorous  betrayal.

The DETERRENT Act takes critical steps to safeguard our institutions,  protect our students, and preserve American values. We must not allow  profit to overshadow patriotism. It is time to reclaim our universities  and secure our future. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this  legislation.
