Recognizing the Slcc Cross Country Team


Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  achievements of the Salt Lake Community College Cross Country Program-- a testament to the determination, resilience, and spirit of Utah's  student-athletes.

In Richmond, Virginia, at the National Junior College Athletic  Association (NJCAA) Cross Country Championships, the SLCC Bruins made  history by sweeping both the men's and women's races, capturing  national titles on both sides. This remarkable accomplishment speaks to  the extraordinary talent and dedication of the student-athletes and  coaching staff.

The women's team claimed its second consecutive national  championship, dominating the field and finishing 46 points ahead of  their closest competitors. Their impressive victory continued just two  days later, as they claimed first place in the NJCAA Half Marathon  National Championship, a historic feat for SLCC and a significant  milestone in women's athletics at the college.

On the men's side, the Bruins secured second place in the NJCAA Half  Marathon National Championship, demonstrating their competitive edge  and depth of talent.

These achievements would not have been possible without the  leadership of Head Coach Isaac Wood, who was named NJCAA National Coach  of the Year, along with Assistant Coaches Kelsey Gilbert, Aiden  Carlson, and Tom Gruenewald. Athletic Director Kevin Dustin has also  been instrumental in fostering a culture of excellence at SLCC.

Mr. Speaker, as Chair of the Higher Education and Workforce  Development Subcommittee and a former athlete myself, I know firsthand  the importance of athletic programs in shaping character and building  future leaders. The success of the Salt Lake Community College Cross  Country Program is not just a win for Utah, but an inspiration for  aspiring athletes everywhere.

I applaud the SLCC Cross Country Program for their extraordinary  accomplishments, and I look forward to seeing their continued success  in the years to come. Their hard work, resilience, and sportsmanship  embody the best of what it means to be a Bruin.
