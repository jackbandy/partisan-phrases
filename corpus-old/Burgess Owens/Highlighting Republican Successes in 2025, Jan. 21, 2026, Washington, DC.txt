Highlighting Republican Successes in 2025


Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, America is back, and so is common sense.

This last year has reminded us of what is possible when America has a  competent and respected leader who understands the unique role that our  great Nation should fill on the world stage.

I am grateful to have President Donald J. Trump back in the White  House with the strength and vision needed to be the leader of the free  world. One of the things I have admired most about the President is  that he is the same man behind closed doors as he is in front of the  camera. Whether you like him or not, you know what he stands for  exactly, and he will act on that.

It is the type of leadership that has delivered real results for the  American people. We have seen real results on our southern border as  illegal crossings and the flow of illicit drugs has dropped  significantly.

Families are feeling real relief at the gas pump and grocery store as  their wages are going up and opportunities are increasing. In our  schools and military, the emphasis is, once again, on merit instead of  discriminatory DEI standards. In America, success should be earned and  not engineered by woke bureaucrats. It is called common sense.

Every day of this last year, the President and House Republicans have  worked to ensure that you keep more of your own money and remove the  red tape so you can thrive. We are blessed to live in the greatest  country in the history of mankind every single day. America's brightest  days are ahead of us, and I am grateful to have a Commander in Chief  who believes in the spirit and promise of America. He is a leader who  is working to make sure this beautiful country remains the land of  freedom and opportunity for all who are willing to work hard, take  responsibility, and dream big.
