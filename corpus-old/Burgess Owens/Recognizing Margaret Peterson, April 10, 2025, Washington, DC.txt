Recognizing Margaret Peterson


Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Margaret Peterson,  a dedicated public servant and respected leader in West Valley City.

Margaret served on the city council for 18 years, always putting  families and students first. She is also the founder and Executive  Director of the Community Education Partnership, a nonprofit that  supports afterschool programs across the city.

Under her leadership, the program has reached over 15,000 students  from 20 elementary schools, four junior highs, one high school, and  several charter schools. It has helped improve academic outcomes,  encouraged stronger attendance, and given students a safe place to  grow.

In 2024, West Valley City honored Margaret with the ``Essential  Piece'' award--a heartfelt recognition of her decades of service and  the lives she's touched through education and community building.

Her example is one we should all aspire to.
