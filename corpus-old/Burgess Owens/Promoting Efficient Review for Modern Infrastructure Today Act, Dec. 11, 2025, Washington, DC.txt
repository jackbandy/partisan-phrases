Promoting Efficient Review for Modern Infrastructure Today Act


Mr. OWENS. Mr. Chairman, I, too, thank Chairman Graves for his  leadership in advancing commonsense permitting reform that cuts red  tape and restores accountability to Federal decisionmaking.

I am proud that one of our top priorities this Congress, the Water  Quality Criteria Development and Transparency Act, is included in this  package. This legislation will finally bring clarity and consistency to  the Clean Water Act permitting process by requiring the EPA to publish  clear, accessible guidance on water quality certifications.

For Utah and other Western States, where water is scarce and  infrastructure projects are critical to our growth, this reform is a  game changer. Too often, confusing, and inconsistent permitting rules  delay or derail projects that communities depend on, whether it is  water storage, energy development, or transportation.

The PERMIT Act is about delivering certainty and efficiency without  compromising environmental standards. I am proud to support it, and I  look forward to getting this across the finish line for Utahns and for  Americans across the country.
