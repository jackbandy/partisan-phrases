Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Chairwoman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, after blatant obstruction and prolonged delay on the  part of congressional Democrats for over 40 days, the House has  returned to regular order. It is good to be back, and it is about time.

Today, we are here to advance eight separate measures that meet the  demands of the American people and strengthen President Trump's  successful America First agenda.

My constituents voted for the dissolution of the Biden bureaucratic  barrage and for safety in their communities. From bolstering American  energy dominance to upholding law and order, strengthening the criminal  justice system in our Nation's Capital to rejecting the failed ideology  of socialism, House Republicans continue to deliver measurable and  substantive progress.

I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the eight underlying  pieces of legislation. Let's continue delivering wins for the American  people.
