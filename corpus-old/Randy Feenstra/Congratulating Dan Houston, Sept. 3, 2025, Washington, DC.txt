Congratulating Dan Houston


Mr. FEENSTRA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my friend and  fellow Iowan, Dan Houston, on his retirement from Principal Financial  Group after 41 years of service.

From starting his first job with Principal in 1984 to eventually  becoming chairman, president, and CEO, Dan exemplifies the power of  hard work and dedication. His decisions have helped more families  achieve financial security and plan for tomorrow.

Dan has also committed himself and Principal Financial to  philanthropic causes in Des Moines and across the State of Iowa.

Under his leadership, Principal donated generously to United Way and  the annual Principal charity golf classic which raised millions of  dollars for Iowa youth. The Principal Foundation awards grants to  worthy causes including disaster recovery, affordable housing, and  small business development.

Dan has always prioritized the people whom Principal Financial  serves, putting families and our communities first.

In his retirement, Dan will have more time to focus on the things  that truly matter most: spending time with his wife, Joanie, his  children, and his grandchildren, and devoting his talents to causes and  organizations near and dear to his heart.

I thank Dan for his incredible contributions to Iowa and wish him and  his family the very best in his next chapter of life.
