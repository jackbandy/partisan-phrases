Trump Rescissions Request and Usaid Cuts


Mrs. FOUSHEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to Trump's  rescission package, which includes an unfathomable $8.2 billion cut to  USAID funding.

My home State of North Carolina is the fourth largest recipient of  USAID funding, which invests roughly $194 million into our State  economy. Gutting this support threatens local jobs, weakens our  research institutions, and undermines the economic stability of  communities across my State.

In my district alone, the damaging effects of the administration's  cuts to USAID are already being felt. Thousands of talented  professionals have lost their jobs, and vital partnerships with our  local universities have been terminated.

These devastating cuts are not only costing people their livelihoods  here at home but are also putting lives at risk around the world.

USAID is a cornerstone of our national security, advancing global  health, powering research across the country, and reinforcing America's  leadership on the world stage.

Slashing this funding will be disastrous for our allies, destabilize  vulnerable regions, and hurt communities. We cannot stand for it.
