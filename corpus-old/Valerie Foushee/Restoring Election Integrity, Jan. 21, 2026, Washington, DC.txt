Restoring Election Integrity


Mrs. FOUSHEE. Mr. Speaker, today marks 16 years since the Supreme  Court handed down its disastrous Citizens United decision, a ruling  that opened the floodgates to unlimited corporate money in our  elections and fundamentally distorted our democracy.

By discarding decades of precedent, the Supreme Court declared that  unlimited spending in elections poses no threat to our democratic  system and that corporations are entitled to the same political rights  as the people whose lives are governed by the outcomes of those  elections.

What emerged from this transfer of power was an election system that  no longer depends primarily on voters but rather on outside entities  whose sole purpose is to spend unlimited money, often without public  accountability, to influence who holds power and how that power is  used.

Since Citizens United, we have watched a parallel political system  take shape, one dominated by super-PACs and dark money organizations  that can raise and spend unlimited sums and operate with fewer rules,  less transparency, and the ability to determine election outcomes long  before voters cast a ballot. A small number of wealthy donors now wield  influence far out of proportion to the voters they seek to affect.

This concentration of power has consequences for how this institution  functions. When unlimited outside spending can be deployed against a  single vote, it shapes the decisions lawmakers can take. It narrows the  range of feasibility policy. It rewards delay and protects entrenched  interests, often at the expense of the public's priorities.

Meanwhile, Americans face one of the most pressing affordability  crises in decades. Healthcare, housing, childcare, energy, and grocery  costs are all rising, yet policies that could provide immediate relief  are repeatedly stalled.

At the same time, industries that benefit from higher costs or weaker  enforcement continue to earn record profits and protect their advantage  with unlimited political spending. Although Citizens United did not  create these problems, it enabled them to persist and grow.

While the long-term goal must be to overturn Citizens United through  a constitutional amendment, Congress has the power and the  responsibility to act immediately to limit its damage.

The American people deserve a government that answers to them.  Sixteen years of Citizens United is long enough. We must restore  accountability, strengthen transparency, and defend the voice of every  voter.
