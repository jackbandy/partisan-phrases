Fired By President Trump


Mrs. FOUSHEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as the Representative of  North Carolina's Fourth Congressional District, and the home of the  Research Triangle Park, to share the story of a Federal scientist, in  their own words, who was fired by President Trump and Elon Musk.

I worked for the Department of Health and Human Services. I       was responsible for leading technical oversight over the       Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network in order to       ensure patient safety, maximal usage of donated organs,       continued confidence in the donor system, efficient spending       of taxpayer dollars, and a secure, modern technology       infrastructure.

These aggressive and sweeping mass firings of hundreds of thousands  of Federal employees will have profound and devastating consequences  across the country.

Our dedicated civil servants work tirelessly each day to deliver  essential services, conduct critical scientific research, and ensure  the safety of our communities. They deserve better.
