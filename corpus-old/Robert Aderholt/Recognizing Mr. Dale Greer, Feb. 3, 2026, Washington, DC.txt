Recognizing Mr. Dale Greer


Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Mr.  Dale Greer upon his retirement and to commend him for a lifetime of  service to the Cullman community and the State of Alabama. Over the  course of more than three decades in economic development, Mr. Greer  has helped shape the future of Cullman County through his steady  leadership, dedication to public service, and commitment to creating  opportunities for others.

Mr. Greer was born in Birmingham and moved to Cullman with his family  more than 50 years ago. Cullman has been his home ever since, and his  career reflects a deep and lasting investment in the place and people  he has served.

Throughout his professional life, Mr. Greer earned a reputation as  someone who could be trusted to bring people together, solve problems,  and make progress happen. In addition to his work in economic  development, he also served the community in many roles over the years,  including time spent working at the local electric cooperative and  Chamber of Commerce, as well as earlier work as a newspaper reporter  and managing editor--experiences that helped shape his understanding of  the community he would go on to serve so faithfully.

Mr. Greer's influence can be seen through his involvement with  numerous civic and community organizations. He has served as a founding  member of the Board of Directors for the Cullman Parks & Recreation  Foundation, contributed to the Cullman Rotary Club, and supported  Wallace State Community College through the Future Foundation and  Alumni Association. He also served on the Cullman Area Chamber of  Commerce Board of Directors and helped establish the Leadership Cullman  program, as a member of its first graduating class.

Mr. Greer's service has extended beyond Cullman as well. He served as  Past President of the Economic Development Association of Alabama and  was appointed to the Alabama Workforce Council, where he served as  Chairman. He also represented Alabama through the Southern Economic  Development Council and was later named an Honorary Life Member.

Among Mr. Greer's many accomplishments, he helped develop the  Operation Round-up Program for the Cullman Electric Cooperative and  Cullman Power Board, an initiative that has generated millions of  dollars to support students by allowing customers to round up their  bills to the next highest dollar. He also served as the project manager  for the Duck River Dam and Reservoir Project, which helped secure  Cullman's water source for the next 100 years and stands as one of the  most significant long-term infrastructure achievements for the region.

Mr. Greer has also demonstrated a lifelong commitment to professional  growth and excellence. He is a graduate of the University of Oklahoma  Economic Development Institute, completed coursework at Georgia Tech,  and attended the Intensive Economic Development Course at Auburn  University. He is also a graduate of Wallace State Community College  and Athens State University.

Retirement marks the close of one chapter and the beginning of  another, but the impact of Dale Greer's work will continue to be felt  for decades to come. His leadership, service, and devotion to Cullman  County have left an enduring legacy that will benefit families,  businesses, and future generations.

Mr. Speaker, I would also like to recognize Mr. Greer's family, who  has supported him throughout his distinguished career and years of  service. Dale is married to his wife, Larraine, and together they are  proud parents to Jeremy Greer, Cory Greer, Casey Link, Alex Boike and  Brandon Boike. Mr. Greer also has seven grandchildren.

I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Mr. Dale Greer on  his retirement, and I extend my sincere gratitude to him for his many  years of service to our community and our great State of Alabama.
