Recognizing Wallace State Community College and its President, Dr. Vicki P. Karolewics


Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize Wallace State  Community College and its President, Dr. Vicki P. Karolewics, for their  outstanding achievements and national recognition.

Wallace State was recently named one of the top three community  colleges in the Nation by the Aspen Institute, earning the Rising Star  designation in the 2025 Aspen Prize for Community College Excellence.  It also became the first Alabama community college ever selected as a  finalist for this prestigious award. Wallace State continues to fulfill  its mission of ``learning that transforms lives and communities,''  providing opportunities that strengthen individuals, families, and the  State of Alabama.

Under the leadership of Dr. Karolewics, who has served as president  since 2003, Wallace State has become a national model for excellence,  innovation, and service. Student outcomes far exceed national averages,  with graduation, persistence, transfer, and job placement rates among  the best in the country. The college generates more than $276 million  annually in economic impact and supports more than 4,000 jobs across  its region, while enrolling nearly 10,000 students each year in credit,  workforce, adult education, and dual enrollment programs.

Dr. Karolewics herself has been recognized nationally and statewide  for her leadership, serving on higher education boards and councils and  receiving numerous awards for her contributions to education, workforce  development, and public service. She demonstrates the transformative  power of education and serves countless students while advancing  Wallace State to national prominence.

Mr. Speaker, I commend Wallace State Community College and Dr. Vicki  P. Karolewics for their impact on students, communities, and the State  of Alabama, and I congratulate them on this well-deserved national  recognition.
