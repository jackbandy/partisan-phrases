Welcoming His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew


Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize and welcome to  Washington, His All-Holiness Bartholomew Archbishop of Constantinople- New Rome and Ecumenical Patriarch, the spiritual leader of Orthodox  Christianity worldwide. As the Archbishop of Constantinople-New Rome,  His All-Holiness serves as the spiritual head of the second largest  Christian Church in the world.

His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew was elected in  October 1991 as the 270th Archbishop of the 2,000-year-old Church  founded by the Apostle Andrew. For more than three decades, he has  stood at the forefront of the cause of religious freedom, interfaith  dialogue, and peacebuilding, making him the longest-serving Archbishop  of Constantinople in the history of Christianity.

Born Demetrios Arhondonis in 1940 on an island in Turkey, His All- Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew pursued theological studies  in Rome, Switzerland, Germany, and Greece before joining leadership  within the Church. He is fluent in numerous languages and has been  recognized by academic institutions worldwide, holding honorary  doctorates from universities across Europe, the United States, and  beyond.

Throughout his tenure, His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch  Bartholomew has worked to advance religious liberty and human rights,  to strengthen ties among Christian denominations, and to build  relationships among the Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity, and  Islam. He has co-sponsored international peace conferences, supported  reconciliation in conflict-ridden regions, and spoken out for  persecuted groups across the globe.

His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew is no stranger to  our Nation's Capitol. In 1997, during his first official visit as His  All-Holiness, he was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in a ceremony  in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda. On that occasion, he reminded us that,  ``The Pentagon embodies might, but the Capitol embodies right. In these  halls different points of view meet and are reconciled. . . And most  important to the Orthodox Church during many dark ages--in these halls  human rights are preserved and human dignity is enhanced.''

This week, His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew will  return to Washington as part of his visit to the United States, where  he will also receive the distinguished Templeton Prize in New York  City, an award previously bestowed upon Mother Teresa, the Dalai Lama,  and Archbishop Desmond Tutu. This honor recognizes his lifelong  commitment to faith, peace, and science.

Mr. Speaker, it is fitting that we welcome His All-Holiness  Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew back to Washington, D.C. and recognize  his remarkable contributions as a global religious leader, peacemaker,  and advocate for freedom. His presence is a reminder of the enduring  values of faith, dialogue, and human dignity.
