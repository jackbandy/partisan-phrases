Incinerating 500 Tons of Emergency Food Aid


Mr. MAGAZINER. Madam Speaker, I rise for the 32nd time to call on the  Trump administration to restore lifesaving food aid for malnourished  children.

Last week, it was reported that the Trump administration is  incinerating 500 tons of emergency food aid because it expired while  sitting in a warehouse. This is food that had already been paid for,  had already been produced, and was just waiting to be shipped to  starving people who needed it to survive. Instead, it is being  incinerated.

In my district in Rhode Island, 87,000 boxes of lifesaving nutrition  are sitting in Edesia Nutrition's warehouse. It is already paid for,  already produced, and waiting to be shipped. This is food aid that is  designed to treat starving children whose organs have shut down to the  point where they cannot process normal food.

Madam Speaker, what are we doing here? This is food that is already  paid for, already produced, and sitting in warehouses while kids  starve.

I am going to stand on this floor every day until the administration  honors its word and restores lifesaving food aid.
