Restoring Lifesaving Food Aid for Malnourished Children


Mr. MAGAZINER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today for the 37th time to demand  that the Trump administration restore lifesaving food aid for  malnourished children.

This is Plumpy'Nut. It is manufactured in my district to treat kids  who are starving to death.

Mr. Speaker, when children are starving, their organs stop working.  They cannot digest regular food. This is their only chance at getting  back to health.

It took the Trump administration 10 days to put a stop to USAID's  shipments of Plumpy'Nut to starving children around the world. Since  then, they have promised over and over again that the program will  restart.

They have issued RFPs. They have said that they are going to start  shipping again, but it has been 9 months. It took them 10 days to shut  down this program and 9 months and counting to get it going again.

Every day that they delay and drag their feet is a day that children  are starving. Stop the excuses. Stop the delay. Restore this program. I  will speak out on this floor every day until the program is restored.
