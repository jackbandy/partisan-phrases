Support for Edesia


Mr. MAGAZINER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today for the fourth time to call  for funding for lifesaving food aid to be restored by the Trump  administration.

Sudan is suffering its worst famine in four decades. Without  immediate help, hundreds of thousands could die. Mothers are walking  for days in search of food, and children collapsing into their arms  from hunger.

For years, the United States has stepped up in the face of these  tragedies. Edesia, an organization in my district in Rhode Island,  produces ready-made, ready-to-use food therapeutics called Plumpy'Nut  that has saved millions of lives in Sudan and more than 60 other  countries.

The Trump administration has stopped submitting new orders, and now  boxes of this lifesaving food intended for Sudan sits in warehouses in  Rhode Island awaiting a transportation contract to be approved while  children starve.

Trump administration officials continue to say that they intend to  resume shipping this emergency food aid, but they have yet to do so.

Keep your promise. Restart the aid.
