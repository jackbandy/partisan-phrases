Streamlining Procurement for Effective Execution and Delivery and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2026


Mr. MAGAZINER. Mr. Chair, the gentleman from New Jersey is asking for  a review that has already been done. The Department of Defense in no  uncertain terms stated in this December 2024 letter, just 10 months  ago, that the Revolution Wind project would not have adverse impacts on  DOD missions in the area. The Air Force, NORAD, and the Navy all  participated in the review of Revolution Wind.

In fact, if you read the BOEM record of decision, if you actually  read the record of decision, there is a whole section on radar where it  talks about how that has been addressed, the situation has been taken  care of, and the Department of Defense has signed off on it.

What this is really about is the larger war on clean energy that this  side of the aisle is waging that has led to hundreds of people in my  district being put off the jobsite, and a project that is 80 percent  complete is dormant right now while my constituents are desperate for  lower energy prices.

Do you want to talk about national defense? This amendment would hurt  our national defense. Why? If we want to achieve American energy  independence and not be dependent on other parts of the world, we  should be opening the door to affordable, clean energy, not fighting  with one hand behind our back.
