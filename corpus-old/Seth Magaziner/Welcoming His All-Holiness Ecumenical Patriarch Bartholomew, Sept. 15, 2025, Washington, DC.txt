Welcoming His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew


Mr. MAGAZINER. Mr. Speaker, I am glad to welcome His All-Holiness  Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew to the United States to accept the  distinguished Templeton Prize. As the Representative for Rhode Island's  2nd Congressional District, I welcome Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew  on behalf of the vibrant Greek Orthodox constituency in my district,  including at the Church of the Annunciation in Cranston, Rhode Island.

The Church of the Annunciation was the first Orthodox Parish  established in Rhode Island, and it now consists of over 600 families  throughout the state. Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew's dedication to  his faith, raising concern for the environment, and promoting peaceful  coexistence is a blessing to us all that spreads optimism for a  brighter future.
