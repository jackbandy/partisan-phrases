Restore Food Aid Funding


Mr. MAGAZINER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today for the 31st time to call on  the Trump administration to restore lifesaving food aid for  malnourished children.

Over the weekend, I had a chance to visit the Edesia Nutrition  factory in North Kingstown, Rhode Island, one of two factories in the  United States that manufactures this ready-to-use therapeutic food.  This is used to treat starving children whose organs have failed and  are no longer able to process traditional food to get them back to  health.

For years, the United States saved millions of lives with this  product, sourced entirely from U.S. farmers and factories, until the  Trump administration froze funding.

The time has come for that funding to be restored, as the  administration promised they would do, but have not delivered on.

For the 31st time, my message is simple: If you say you will do it,  do it. I will keep speaking out every day until the administration  honors its word.

Restore the funding.
