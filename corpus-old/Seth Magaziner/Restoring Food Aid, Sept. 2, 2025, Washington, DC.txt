Restoring Food Aid


Mr. MAGAZINER. Mr. Speaker, I rise for the 34th time to call on the  Trump administration to restore lifesaving food aid for malnourished  children.

As a reminder, in January, the Trump administration stopped funding  for emergency food aid that had been appropriated by Congress. Since  then, despite saying all the right things, that the funding is going to  be restored, that the shipments are going to start again, they continue  to drag their feet.

Edesia Nutrition, in my district, manufactures some of that food aid  designed to help starving children get back to health. After 8 months,  thousands of boxes are still sitting in a warehouse in Rhode Island  instead of getting to kids who are starving to death.

Now, the administration finally awarded a contract a few weeks ago,  after 8 months of delays, but the company has still not been told where  to ship to.

Where is the urgency? Children are dying. Step after step, the  administration has dragged its feet in restarting the program that they  cut off back in January.

I will keep speaking out every day until the administration honors  its word. Ship the product. Save lives.
