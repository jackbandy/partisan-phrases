Restore Lifesaving Food Aid for Children


Mr. MAGAZINER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, for the 38th time, to call  on the Trump administration to restore lifesaving food aid for starving  children around the world.

It has been 8 months since the Trump administration put a stop-work  order in place. As a result, there are thousands of boxes of lifesaving  aid meant to save the lives of starving children sitting in warehouses  in Rhode Island and Georgia instead of getting to the kids who need  them.

Mr. Speaker, this week, we are voting on the annual Defense bill. I  just want to point out that this is a national security issue because  when starvation and famine are permitted to progress unimpeded around  the world, it yields terrorism, increased violence, and extremism that  is a risk to our own Nation's defense.

When we step back, our adversaries, like China, step in to save the  day in the developing world. That is bad for the United States and for  democracies all across the globe.

Mr. Speaker, I call on the Trump administration, once again: Restore  lifesaving food aid for children.
