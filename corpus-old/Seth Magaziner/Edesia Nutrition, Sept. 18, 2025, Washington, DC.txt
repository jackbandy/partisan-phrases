Edesia Nutrition


Mr. MAGAZINER. Mr. Speaker, I rise for the 42nd time to call on the  Trump administration to restore lifesaving food aid for starving  children. Edesia Nutrition, an organization in my district,  manufactures Plumpy'Nut, a nutritional supplement that helps starving  children get back to health.

Their production has been largely shut down since the Trump  administration froze the program in January. I have been speaking out  on this floor for months, calling on that program to be restored.

We have had an interesting challenge that we have been trying to  figure out which is: When do we declare victory? I think that every day  I come up here might be my last. Time after time, the Trump  administration has said they will restore the program. They put in  purchase orders. They put out RFPs. They have tweeted. They have  posted. They have testified this program will be restarted. Yet,  thousands of boxes remain stuck in a warehouse in Rhode Island, instead  of getting to the children who need it.

Mr. Speaker, I will continue to speak on this floor every day until  those boxes move because promises and intentions are not enough to save  the lives of starving children.
