Halt All Lethal Trafficking of Fentanyl Act


Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S.  331, the HALT Fentanyl Act.

This bipartisan bill will save lives by providing critical tools for  law enforcement to combat the ongoing opioid crisis across our country.

Thousands of Americans continue to die each year from fentanyl  overdoses, and Ohio has been particularly hard-hit by the epidemic.

Prior to the temporary rescheduling in 2018, fentanyl-related  substances could only be controlled individually, allowing cartel  chemists to easily create new uncontrolled compounds. This temporary  rescheduling proved to be effective as the number of new compounds  since then has significantly declined.

The prevalence of fentanyl-related substances and continued  trafficking of dangerous narcotics across our southern border requires  strong, decisive action from our Congress.

According to the DEA, there were more than 36 million fentanyl pills  and nearly 4,000 pounds of fentanyl powder seized in 2025. This  represents over 157 million deadly doses.

As a former prosecutor and a co-chair of the Addiction, Treatment,  and Recovery Caucus, I understand the importance of law enforcement  aggressively targeting traffickers and making sure that we are  addressing societal challenges of addiction.

Each life lost to an overdose is a tragedy. We must declare war on  the drugs that are killing our kids in our community.

Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill and send  it to the President's desk.
