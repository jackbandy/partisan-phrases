Congratulating West De Pere Phantoms Football Team


Mr. WIED. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize and congratulate the  West De Pere Phantoms football team for winning the WIAA Division 2  High School State Championship.

Following an impressive regular season and dominant performance in  the playoffs, the West De Pere Phantoms traveled to Camp Randall  Stadium in Madison to compete in the 2025 WIAA Division 2 State  Football Championship.

In a hard-fought matchup, the West De Pere team won its third State  title in program history. The Phantoms' defense held their opponent to  zero points in the second half, and the offense broke records on the  way to a 28-14 victory.

I commend the coaching staff and the entire Phantoms team for their  hard work and dedication that led to this unforgettable season.

I also want to give a special shoutout to the father-son duo of West  De Pere Head Coach Chris Greisen and all-star quarterback Patrick  Greisen, who set the Division 2 record for total passing yards in a  championship game, an extraordinary achievement on an already memorable  day.

Mr. Speaker, I once again congratulate the team on this  accomplishment, and I look forward to seeing many more championship  wins in their future. I am proud to recognize this talented team, and I  urge my colleagues to join me in applauding their outstanding season.
