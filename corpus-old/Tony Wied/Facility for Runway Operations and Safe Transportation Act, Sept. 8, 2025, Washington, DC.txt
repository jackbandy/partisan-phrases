Facility for Runway Operations and Safe Transportation Act


Mr. WIED. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3423,  the Facility for Runway Operations and Safe Transportation Act, or the  FROST Act.

This bipartisan legislation makes a simple but critical update to  title 49 of the United States Code by including aircraft deicing  storage facilities in the definition of airport development.

In cold weather States like Wisconsin and many others across the  country, safe and efficient deicing operations are essential to keeping  passengers, crews, and cargo moving during winter months.

Aircraft are uniquely sensitive to any amount of ice and snow that  accumulates on the airframe, causing irregularities that add weight,  interrupt airflow, and can come loose during flight, potentially  damaging critical flight systems.

By clarifying that these storage facilities qualify for Federal  Airport Improvement Program funding, the FROST Act empowers airports to  invest in infrastructure that protects lives and strengthens regional  economies.

This bill reflects a shared commitment to aviation safety and  practical governance. It has support from both sides of the aisle and  has been favorably reported by the Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure.

I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense measure.
