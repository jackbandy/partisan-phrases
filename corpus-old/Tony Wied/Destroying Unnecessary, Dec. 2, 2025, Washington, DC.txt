Destroying Unnecessary, Misaligned, and Prohibitive Red Tape Act


Mr. WIED. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 4305,  the Destroying Unnecessary, Misaligned, and Prohibitive Red Tape Act,  also known as the DUMP Red Tape Act.

For too long, America's small businesses have been buried under  costly regulations. After suffering through 4 years of regulatory  onslaught by the Biden administration, totaling nearly $1.8 trillion in  new costs and requiring an additional 360 million hours to comply with  these new regulations, small businesses are desperate for regulatory  relief.

A report published last December by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce  found that over half of small business owners view the cost of  complying with regulations as a barrier to growth.

Small businesses are forced to navigate complex environmental  reporting requirements, overtime and wage rules that change from one  administration to the next, and lengthy permitting processes that can  delay construction projects for months or even years.

Family-owned shops face costly data privacy mandates designed for  multinational corporations, while contractors struggle with ever- shifting OSHA paperwork requirements that eat up their time better  spent on the jobsite.

Earlier this year, the Small Business Administration created the Red  Tape Hotline under its Office of Advocacy. This hotline gives small  businesses a seat at the table to highlight the prohibitive red tape  regulations from across Federal agencies that hurt their ability to  grow and compete.

My bill takes that progress further. It codifies the hotline into law  and requires annual reports to Congress so that we know exactly which  rules are holding back growth and what steps are being taken to fix  them.

I am pleased that my bill earned the endorsement of the U.S. Chamber  of Commerce and Associated Builders and Contractors, which recognized  the need for a direct line of communication to the SBA for small  businesses.

The DUMP Red Tape Act is a commonsense way to gather input directly  from the people most harmed by overregulation to allow Congress to take  meaningful action.

Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this important  piece of legislation and stand with America's small businesses.
