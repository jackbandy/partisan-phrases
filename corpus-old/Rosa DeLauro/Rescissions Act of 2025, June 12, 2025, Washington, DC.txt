Rescissions Act of 2025


Mr. Speaker, I am opposed to this bill to aid and abet billionaires  in stealing from the American people and which does nothing to help the  American people with the cost of living.

Since taking office, President Trump and Elon Musk unlawfully have  stolen funds appropriated by Congress, passed by Republicans and  Democrats in the House and in the Senate, and signed into law by the  President, upending the separation of powers and our constitutional  order.

For what end?

It is to hand billionaires and the biggest corporations, who already  pay little or no taxes, another massive tax break. It is 4.5 trillion  of taxpayers' dollars.

Do the Republicans want to talk about wasting taxpayer dollars?

This money is going to the wealthiest people and the biggest  corporations. That is where they should save the money.

They want to make our government so broken, so dysfunctional, so  starved for resources, and so full of incompetent political lackeys and  bereft of experts and professionals that its departments and agencies  cannot feasibly achieve the goals and the missions to which they are  lawfully directed. That is where we are going.

Ultimately, they want to embrace privatization and give the biggest  companies unchecked power. They want to rig the economy against the  middle class, workers, and vulnerable families. They want to ensure the  American people have no faith in the ability of government to do good  in their lives.

Mr. Speaker, there is no inherent authority for the President to  impound and steal funds, and there never has been. I don't care if the  President is Republican or Democrat. The late Justices Scalia and  Rehnquist said so. Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kavanaugh have  said so. By the way, they are no liberal torchbearers.

The Department of Justice and the Government Accountability Office  have said so. Over 200 years of American history say so. Our Founding  Fathers designed our government so.

Alexander Hamilton said: ``But where the purse is lodged in one  branch, and the sword in another, there can be no danger.'' The power  of the purse resides in the United States Congress.

This rescissions package dated May 28, submitted June 3, 134 days  after the President began unlawfully freezing funding, is an admission  by President Trump and Russ Vought that they are breaking the law by  impounding $425 billion in appropriated funds across the government.  They do not care about the consequences for Americans.

This is a bill to codify the rights of billionaires and to  rubberstamp the right of billionaires to steal from rural and  vulnerable American communities, children, and the global poor, for the  sake of handing even more money to billionaires. Congress needs to  fight for the middle class, for the working class, and for the most  vulnerable, not to protect the interests of billionaires and big  corporations.

Members considering voting for this own the reckless cuts done by  Elon Musk.

This is a bill to shut down rural television and radio stations,  cutting off coverage of local news, eliminating emergency information  like severe weather alerts, and jeopardizing access to PBS KIDS  children's programs like ``Sesame Street.''

This is a bill to rip lifesaving support away from the hungry,  displaced, and sick people in developing countries and conflict zones  across the globe and to end programs that treat deadly diseases and  prevent pandemics.

This is a bill to abandon the people of Ukraine while they resist  Putin's tyranny.

This is a bill to cut $400 million from PEPFAR, a paragon of American  leadership that has saved the lives of 26 million mothers and fathers,  sons and daughters. Instead of facing a death sentence, people  supported by PEPFAR are raising families, building their communities,  and helping their communities grow and develop.

This is a bill that puts America last. When we retreat from the world  diplomatically and through our assistance to vulnerable people, then  America will be alone, without allies, and in a less stable world  without the support of the international community.

Mr. Speaker, do you know who will come out ahead?

China, Russia, and Iran. When people in need see bags of food and  flour coming through that say USA, that shows the power of the United  States. That now will be traded for food aid from China.

We are here today considering cuts after months of unlawful  impoundment, stealing, that will conceal a Republican reconciliation  bill to make the billionaires in America even more rich and increase  the debt by $3 trillion. Mr. Speaker, you increase the debt. You rip  health insurance away from at least 16 million Americans.

This bill rescinds $9.4 billion, which Congress just appropriated not  even 3 months ago. Now the President is asking the Congress to  rubberstamp its proposal to steal from the American people without  concern for the consequences. This bill does nothing to help the  American people with the cost of living. The President said he was  going to bring it down on the first day. He has done nothing but make  it worse.

Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this bill which  forfeits our global leadership, undermines national security, and  steals from the American people to hand more wealth to billionaires.

Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in fierce  opposition to the Republicans' reckless rescission bill, a backdoor  scheme to claw back critical Federal funding that protects America's  global leadership, public safeguards, and trusted public broadcasting,  all while bypassing congressional constitutional authority.

Let's be clear: This is not a budget tweak. It is an attack on our  values; a direct hit to our national health, safety, and prosperity;  and a green light for authoritarian overreach.

This package guts essential investments in international development  and humanitarian programs, lifesaving tools that fight disease, prevent  terrorism, supports democracy, and open markets for American  businesses.

Here is the kicker, Mr. Speaker: Congress approved this funding just  2 months ago, and Donald Trump signed it into law. Now, Republicans  want to rip it back to cover up the massive hole they are blowing in  the deficit with tax giveaways for billionaires. Their so-called fiscal  responsibility comes at the expense of starving children, crumbling  democracies, and public-private partnerships that channel American  innovation to solve the world's toughest challenges.

Mr. Speaker, foreign assistance, which has long represented just  about 1 percent of our national budget, is not charity. It is strategy.

Don't take my word for it. Military leaders from both parties have  warned us for years. If we fail to lead with soft power, we will end up  paying in blood, bombs, and more boots on the ground.

Cutting foreign assistance will: deepen desperation, fuel extremism,  and push fragile societies toward collapse. When that happens, we all  pay the price. Refugee crises will surge. Diseases will spread, and  trade routes will shut down. Our troops and diplomats face greater  danger, and our homeland security is weakened.

Here is an example of what is on the chopping block: PEPFAR, which  has saved over 26 million lives and nearly 8 million babies from being  born with HIV; food assistance, which stabilizes communities and  creates agricultural markets; and public-private partnerships that  channel American innovation to solve the world's toughest challenges.

Let's talk about what happens when we pull back. When the United  States steps away, others step in and not with good intentions. China  is flooding developing countries with infrastructure loans and digital  surveillance systems. Russia is exporting mercenaries and  disinformation. While we are debating whether to send a bag of rice or  a clean water pump, our adversaries are buying influence, forging  military alliances, and rewriting the rules of global engagement.

This is not theoretical. This is happening right now. Let's take  Africa, for example, a region poised to become one-quarter of the  world's population. U.S. assistance has helped build stability there  through nutrition programs, education, and public health. If we walk  away now, we are not just abandoning our values. We are surrendering  one of the world's fastest growing marketplaces to China.

Let's be clear: Regions we assist aren't just aid recipients. They  are emerging economies and future trading partners. Pulling back opens  the door for authoritarian regimes like China to dominate the future,  commerce, connectivity, and development.

This is not just cruel. It is strategically self-defeating and  economically foolish.

Make no mistake, this rescission package is Project 2025 in action-- dismantling our institutions, silencing oversight, and handing U.S.  global leadership over to the dictators on a silver platter, leaving us  alone in the world.

This bill attempts to rubberstamp the Trump administration's illegal  actions, blocking funding already approved by Congress, firing career  public servants, and hollowing out entire agencies.

Let's be honest. These are not going to lower the costs for American  families. It is not going to reduce the deficit, but it will make the  world more dangerous.

It will make Americans less safe and less prosperous.

Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' on this bill.

Ms. DeLAURO.  Kelly).

Ms. DeLAURO.  Kamlager-Dove).

Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, President Trump promised to bring down the  cost of living. He made it worse. He is illegally stealing  congressionally approved taxpayer dollars, and these are services for  the American people.

If my colleagues want to deal with waste, fraud, and abuse, they have  to deal with cutting back on the $4.5 trillion tax cut for billionaires  that the Republicans supported and voted on, tax cuts for billionaires  and the biggest corporations.

If my colleagues vote for this bill, they own every reckless cut  crafted by Elon Musk. They are rubberstamping illegal cuts, and they  own it.
