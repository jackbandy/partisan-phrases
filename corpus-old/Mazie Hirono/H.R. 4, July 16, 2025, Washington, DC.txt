H.R. 4


Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, when the Senate considers the rescissions  bill, H.R. 4, it is my intention, along with Senators Peters, Blunt  Rochester, and Reed, to make a motion to recommit the bill to the  Committee on Appropriations of the Senate with instructions to report  the same back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on which  the Senate is not in session, with changes that--(1) are within the  jurisdiction of such committee; and  (2) would ensure that no recipient of funds from the Corporation for  Public Broadcasting that is designated as a Primary Entry Point,  National Primary, State Primary, State Relay, State Relay Network,  Local Primary, or Participating National (as those terms are defined in  section 11.18 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations) in the  Emergency Alert System would lose funding as a result of the  rescissions in the bill.
