Recognizing Rodeo Hall of Fame Member, Flint Rasmussen


Mr. DOWNING. Mr. Speaker, in honor of America's 250th birthday,  Members of Congress from the Treasure State are highlighting  exceptional Montanans each month who embody the spirit of our great  state and Nation.

Last year, rodeo was officially recognized as Montana's state sport.  It's only fitting that the first Montanan I honor is Havre native Flint  Rasmussen.

For decades, Flint brought laughter, heart, and unforgettable energy  to rodeo arenas across Montana and the country. His natural talent,  quick wit, and unmistakable flair captivated audiences wherever he  performed.

Making his PBR World Finals debut in 1997, Flint became the  dedicated, exclusive in-arena entertainer for PBR's premier tour in  2006. For more than two decades, fans packed arenas not only to watch  world-class bull riding, but to be entertained by Flint's iconic  performances that became a hallmark of PBR events.

In recognition of his remarkable career, Flint was inducted into the  National Rodeo Hall of Fame in 2024 and the Bull Riding Hall of Fame  last year. Flint Rasmussen didn't just shape Montana's rodeo culture,  he helped define rodeo entertainment across America.

I thank Flint for his innumerable contributions to the fabric of  American culture through his life's work. He has made our state and our  country proud.
