Congratulating Jim Duncan


Mr. DOWNING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my dear  friend, Jim Duncan, on his well-earned retirement as president of the  Billings Clinic Foundation.

For three decades, Jim served the great folks of the Treasure State,  advocating tirelessly for rural healthcare access and the expansion of  community wellness programs. Jim grew the foundation's endowments from  $3 million to an astounding $150 million, funds that will benefit the  community for generations to come.

Jim also played a key role in introducing innovation and excellence  in Montana health services, helping to bring new cancer, cardiac,  pediatric, psychiatric, and trauma care to eastern Montana.

Jim's advocacy will be missed, but I know the foundation will be left  in  good hands with Nichole Mehling at the helm.

Jim led with integrity, vision, and compassion. I wish him and his  wife, Heidi, a well-deserved, adventure-filled retirement.
