Congratulating Montana State University Bobcats


Mr. DOWNING. Mr. Speaker, I have risen before the House several times  to recognize the historic rivalry between the Montana State University  Bobcats and the University of Montana Grizzlies, but today I rise with  enormous pride to honor the Montana State University Bobcats for their  historic FCS National Championship victory in Nashville.

The Cats left it all on the field. They played with grit, heart, and  determination, carrying the weight of a State that believed in them.  From blocked kicks and dramatic momentum swings to a fourth-quarter  comeback and the first overtime finish in FCS title game history, this  contest delivered everything that makes college football unforgettable.

This win marked Montana State's first national championship in 41  years, ending a drought that stretched back to 1984. With Montana  programs reaching the championship stage in four of the last five  seasons, it was only fitting that the trophy finally returned to the  home of the Treasure State.

The young men in blue and gold made Montana proud. Their victory  belongs not only to this university but to an entire State.

Mr. President, if you are watching, we would love to see them in the  White House. Go, Cats, go.
