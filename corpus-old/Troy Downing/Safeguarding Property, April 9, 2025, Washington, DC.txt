Safeguarding Property


Mr. DOWNING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of my bill, the  Safeguarding American Property Act.

In the 119th Congress, House Republicans have sent a clear message to  criminal illegal aliens: If you break our laws, you go home.

Earlier this year, we passed the Laken Riley Act. My Safeguarding  American Property Act builds on the good work of the Laken Riley Act by  expanding the bill to include property crimes like trespassing and  arson as deportable offenses.

Mitigating these types of property crimes is a particularly important  challenge for border States and rural districts like mine which often  have vast distances between homes and businesses and in which law  enforcement resources are often spread thin.

This bill sticks up for those communities and upholds the fundamental  American value of respecting property rights by providing additional  legal requirements that ensure Federal immigration law is properly  enforced.

Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the Safeguarding  American Property Act to further strengthen the good policies codified  in the Laken Riley Act.
