Recognizing the 124th Playing of the Brawl of the Wild As Delivered to Wake Up Montana on Nonstop Local


Mr. DOWNING. Mr. Speaker, this coming weekend marks one of the oldest  and greatest rivalries in all of college football, the ``Brawl of the  Wild.''

Saturday, November 22, 2025, will be the 124th meeting between the  University of Montana Grizzlies and the Montana State Bobcats in  Missoula.

To Montanans, the Brawl of the Wild is more than a football game.  It's a celebration of the state's competitive spirit, community pride,  and deep-rooted traditions.

Many households in Montana are divided, heck, even my office is  divided.

But the magic of the game is its power to unite our state through  sport, bringing together students, alumni, families, and fans who  proudly don their maroon and silver or blue and gold.

The Brawl of the Wild is truly a tradition unlike any other. It  represents the very best of college athletics and the Montana way of  life.

I look forward to a phenomenal game on Saturday and to celebrating  another chapter in this historic Montana rivalry.
