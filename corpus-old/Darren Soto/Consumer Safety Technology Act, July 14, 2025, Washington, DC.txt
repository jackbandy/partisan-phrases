Consumer Safety Technology Act


Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1770, the  Consumer Safety Technology Act. The bill directs the Consumer Product  Safety Commission to launch a pilot program exploring the use of  artificial intelligence so that we can track injury trends, identify  hazards, monitor recalls, and identify products not meeting importation  requirements.

The reality is that the crooks are already using AI. The cops on the  beat need to be able to use this, too. We also heard in committee that  this could help make the CPSC more efficient by the use of this  technology, and it is critical that we protect consumers.

The bill also requires the Department of Commerce and other agencies  to study blockchain technology in the context of consumer products and  safety. Right now, blockchain is an exciting technology. It is new  technology that can be used for data storage and helping AI to analyze  major issues. In addition, it could be in the digital currency form.

The next section also instructs that the FTC shall report to Congress  on its efforts to address unfair and deceptive trade practices related  to tokens, also known as digital currency, and make any recommendations  to improve our Federal agency's ability to protect consumers and  promote innovation.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Chair Latta, Ranking Members Pallone and  Schakowsky, and Representatives Houchin, Trahan, and Castor for joining  me in this important legislation. I urge Members to vote ``yes.''
