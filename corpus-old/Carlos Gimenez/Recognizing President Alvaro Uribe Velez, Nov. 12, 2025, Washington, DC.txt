Recognizing President Alvaro Uribe Velez


Mr. GIMENEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the  former President of the Republic of Colombia, Alvaro Uribe Velez, for  his extraordinary leadership, steadfast defense of democracy, and  unwavering commitment to the safety and prosperity of the Colombian  people.

President Uribe assumed office in 2002 during one of the most  challenging periods in Colombia's modern history, a time marked by  violence, narco-terrorism, and instability. Through his bold and  visionary ``Democratic Security'' policy, President Uribe restored law  and order, dismantled the strongholds of terrorist organizations like  the FARC, and reestablished the authority of the Colombian state across  the nation.

Under his leadership, Colombia's economy flourished through increased  trade and investment. His administration strengthened U.S.-Colombian  relations, culminating in the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement,  which expanded cooperation on security and counter-narcotics efforts.

President Uribe's courage in confronting narco-terrorist groups and  his dedication to the rule of law set a model for democratic  governance. For his leadership, integrity, and tireless defense of  liberty, many regard President  Uribe as the Abraham Lincoln of Colombia, a unifying figure who  preserved his nation's democracy and restored hope to millions.

I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing President Alvaro Uribe  Velez for his historic contributions to the people of Colombia and to  the cause of freedom and democracy.
