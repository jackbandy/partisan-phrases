Congratulating Christopher Columbus High School Explorers


Mr. GIMENEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my high school  alma mater, the Christopher Columbus Explorers, for winning the  national basketball championship.

After securing their fourth consecutive State championship in  Florida's Class 7A, the Explorers made school history by capturing  their first national title and county history as the only Miami-Dade  County high school to ever win a national basketball title.

These young men have demonstrated relentless dedication and  perseverance throughout the season. I am proud to see that their hard  work and commitment was rewarded. I extend my congratulations to Coach  Andrew Moran, his staff, and the entire team on this remarkable  accomplishment.

Through unity, tradition, and excellence they have cemented their  place in Columbus and Miami-Dade County history. ``Forward'';  ``Adelante.''
