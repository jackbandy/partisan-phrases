District of Columbia Local Funds Act, 2025


Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I am pleased to introduce this bill  with Senators Van Hollen, Murray, Alsobrooks, Warner, and Kaine. It has  been endorsed by President Trump and also by the chairman of the House  Appropriations Committee,   Tom Cole.

This bill would simply fix a mistake in the House CR that prevents  the District of Columbia from spending its own tax dollars as part of  its budget, which Congress routinely approves. Congress approves the  authorization of the expenditure of DC local funds, which are paid for  by DC tax revenues.

The first CR that we enacted last year included language to approve  the DC's fiscal year 2025 budget, and that language was continued in  the second CR. However, the House did not extend this anomaly in the  yearlong CR. As a result, unless this bill is passed, DC would have to  operate under its fiscal year 2024 budget for the remainder of 2025,  potentially requiring $1.1 billion in local spending cuts.

Reducing DC's local funding expenditures will not result in a dollar  of Federal savings. Since October 1 of 2024, the District has been  operating under and spending at its approved level for the fiscal year  2025 budget. According to the CBO, this bill does not have any  budgetary cost to the Federal Government. There are no Federal dollars  involved. The issue here is just allowing the DC Government to proceed  to spend its own tax revenues.

Accordingly, I urge all of my colleagues to support this measure to  correct a true inequity.
