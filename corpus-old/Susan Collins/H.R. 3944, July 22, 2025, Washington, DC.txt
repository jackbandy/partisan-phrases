H.R. 3944


Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture  on the motion to proceed on the bipartisan fiscal year 2026 Military  Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations  bill.

I want to thank the majority leader for bringing this important  legislation to the Senate floor.

This bill would address key military infrastructure needs, including  housing improvements for military families, and would provide the  funding to ensure that veterans receive the care and benefits they have  earned through their service to our country.

Last week, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported this measure  in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 26 to 3.

I ask my colleagues to support the motion to allow the Senate to  begin to work its will on this important funding bill and to fulfill  our constitutional responsibility.
