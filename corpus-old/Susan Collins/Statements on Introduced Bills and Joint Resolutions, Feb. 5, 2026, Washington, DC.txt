Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions


Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Accounting  STEM Pursuit Act, which would help address workforce shortages in the  accounting profession by recognizing accounting as a STEM education  subject and adding accounting education programs as an allowable use of  K through 12 Federal grant funding. I want to thank Senator Rosen for  coleading this bill with me.

Accountants play a key role in today's economy. They serve as trusted  advisers for companies large and small, assist in measuring business  performance, help individuals and businesses file their taxes in an  accurate and timely manner, assist government entities with their  finances, and even investigate instances of financial fraud. Yet the  United States is facing a shortage of accountants willing and able to  fill these important economic roles. In Maine, for example,  municipalities have struggled to find accountants to conduct their  annual audits.

Recent trends suggest this shortage will continue. According to the  Bureau of Labor Statistics, about 124,000 job openings for accountants  and auditors are projected each year, on average, over the next decade.  At the same time, fewer students are pursuing accounting degrees than  in prior years.

The Accounting STEM Pursuit Act seeks to improve the accounting  pipeline by expanding K through 12 students' exposure to accounting  programs. As with other areas of STEM education, this bill would  qualify accounting instruction for Federal funds. This recognition  aligns with the increasing need for accounting professionals to have  high-level math and technology skills, including the ability to analyze  big data, ensure data security, and manage cyber security risk.

In particular, this bill would allow States and school districts to  use a portion of their Federal student support and academic enrichment  grant funding to support accounting education, including accounting  career awareness. The Student Support and Academic Enrichment Grant  Program was created as part of the Every Student Succeeds Act and aims  to help States and school districts offer a well-rounded educational  experience to all students. The Accounting STEM Pursuit Act would also  allow school districts to use this flexible grant to strengthen their  accounting curricula.

Businesses and individuals rely on accountants to help them develop  and reach their financial goals. The Accounting STEM Pursuit Act would  help address the shortage of accountants by promoting accounting  education and improving the pipeline of future accountants. I encourage  my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill.                                  ______
