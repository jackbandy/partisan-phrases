100th Anniversary of the New England Council


Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, in 1925, business and government leaders  from throughout New England came together in Poland Springs, ME, to  develop a strategy to reverse the decline in our traditional industries  and our communities. Today, we celebrate a century of accomplishments  by the New England Council to foster prosperity and opportunity.

When Captain John Smith explored our rugged coast more than 400 years  ago, he wrote in his journal that settling this untamed region would  take, ``the best parts of art, judgment, courage, honesty, constancy,  diligence, and industry.'' I know of no better description of the  spirit that guides the New England Council. Congratulations and happy  birthday.
