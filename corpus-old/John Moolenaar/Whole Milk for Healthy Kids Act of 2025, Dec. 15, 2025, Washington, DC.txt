Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act of 2025


Mr. MOOLENAAR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.

Today, I rise in support of the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act. Milk  has long been a cornerstone of children's diets in this country. It  provides high-quality protein, calcium, vitamin D, and other essential  nutrients that growing bodies and young minds need to thrive. For many  kids, milk is the most reliable source of vital nutrients they receive.

This legislation is about common sense and choice. Whole and reduced- fat milk are safe and nutritious options that many children prefer and  are more likely to drink. When kids enjoy milk, they are more likely to  drink it and get the nutrition it offers instead of pouring it down the  drain.

The Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act supports healthier kids and gives  schools the flexibility to meet students where they are, allowing them  to nurture healthy habits that will last a lifetime. It also supports  our dairy farmers by allowing them more ways to meaningfully  participate in healthy school lunch programs.

Let's help our children grow strong and healthy.

I thank the chairman for his leadership on this legislation, and I  urge all my colleague to support it.
