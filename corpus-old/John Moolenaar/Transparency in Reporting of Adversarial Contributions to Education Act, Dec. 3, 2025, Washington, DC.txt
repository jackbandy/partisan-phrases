Transparency in Reporting of Adversarial Contributions to Education Act


Mr. MOOLENAAR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for this time.

China is our Nation's greatest adversary, and it seeks to harm our  country on a daily basis. It thrives in the shadows. It uses fentanyl  precursors, predatory trade practices, and cyberattacks to hurt us.

China also uses informational warfare, and it would love to influence  what American students learn in classrooms, from kindergarten through  college.

The CCP uses our free and open society against us, bankrolling civil  organizations with nice-sounding names to sponsor exchange programs and  curriculums that hide the truth about China.

Earlier this year, my committee highlighted how Montgomery County in  Maryland has sent 31 students to China on a trip paid for by the  People's Republic of China. That is just one example of why the  legislation the House is considering this week is urgently needed.

The CCP does not want Americans to learn about the horrific Cultural  Revolution in their history classes. It does not want young Americans  to know that it slaughtered innocent students at Tiananmen Square, nor  does it want students to learn about the CCP's ongoing Uyghur genocide  and the slave labor that affects the supply chains of clothes and other  products they use every day.

Parents may think the Chinese Communist Party isn't interested in  what their kids are learning, but the CCP wants to influence every  American.

These bills will empower parents, protect students from Chinese  propaganda, and shine a light on how China tries to influence our  education system.

I thank my colleagues for their work on this legislation and my good  friend Chairman Walberg from Michigan for moving the bills through the  committee and bringing them to the floor.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for the bills.
