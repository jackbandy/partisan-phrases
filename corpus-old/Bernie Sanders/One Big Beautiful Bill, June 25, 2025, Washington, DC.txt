One Big Beautiful Bill


Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, the so-called reconciliation bill or Mr.  Trump's Big Beautiful Bill that the Republican leadership is now  attempting to rush through the Senate is a rather extraordinary piece  of legislation. In many respects, given the crises facing our country,  this legislation does exactly the opposite of what should be done.

Whether you are a Democrat, a Republican, or an Independent, you  know--no one has any doubt about it--that our current healthcare system  is broken. It is dysfunctional. It is a cruel system, and it is wildly  expensive. We spend over $14,500 per person on healthcare, double what  most countries around the world pay per person.

And despite all of that spending, some 85 million Americans today are  uninsured or underinsured. And we remain the only major country on  Earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right. And  one out of four people who go into a pharmacy to get their prescription  drugs can't afford that medicine because of the outrageously high  prices.

So now, given that reality, how does this reconciliation bill address  the horrific healthcare crisis that our country is experiencing?

What one might think is that given 85 million people being uninsured  or underinsured, this bill would lower that number. It would provide  healthcare to more Americans. Given the fact that we are spending twice  as much per capita on healthcare as any other nation, one might think  that this legislation would lower the cost of healthcare. Given the  fact that the insurance companies and the drug companies rip us off  every day and make huge profits out of the system, one might think that  this legislation would take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry  and the insurance companies.

Well, if that is what you think rational legislation should do,  understand that this bill does none of that--in fact, does exactly the  opposite.

This legislation, if enacted, would make the largest cut to  healthcare in our Nation's history in order to pay for the largest tax  breaks for the rich that we have ever, ever seen--massive cuts to  healthcare in order to provide tax breaks for billionaires.

The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that this legislation  would cut Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act by over $1 trillion.  Those cuts, along with ending the enhanced premium credits for the ACA,  will lead to 16 million people losing their health insurance.

That is not what Bernie Sanders has said; that is what the director  of the Congressional Budget Office has told us. That is the nonpartisan  group that works with Congress.

Mr. President, this bill, further, for the first time, forces  millions of Medicaid recipients who make as little as $16,000 a year to  pay a $35 copayment every time they visit a doctor. So 16 million  people are thrown off of healthcare. Low-income, working-class people  are now forced to pay a $35 copayment.

What is the impact of all of that? Well, it will not surprise  anybody, if people don't have access to healthcare, if they can't get  to a doctor when they are sick, people will suffer, and tens of  thousands of them will die.

The Yale University School of Public Health and the University of  Pennsylvania estimated in a recent study that if the reconciliation  bill is enacted, over 50,000 Americans will die unnecessarily every  year. That is what we are talking about--50,000 Americans dying  unnecessarily because they are thrown off of healthcare; they can't  afford to see a doctor each and every year.

What is the reason for that? What is the motivation for that horrific  action? It is to give massive tax breaks to the very wealthiest people  in this country, people who do not need them. Not only would millions  of Americans lose their health insurance and tens of thousands of our  constituents needlessly die if this legislation is enacted, rural  hospitals all over this country--rural hospitals that are already  struggling--would be forced to shut down, lay off workers, or  substantially reduce the services they provide. In other words, at a  time when rural America is struggling--and I come from one of the most  rural States in America, that is what Vermont is--this bill would be a  disaster for rural America.

Further, when Trump and the Republicans in Congress make massive cuts  to Medicaid, they are not just attacking individuals, they are also  going after and negatively impacting community health centers, which  provide primary healthcare to 32 million lower income and working-class  Americans in every State in this country. Community health centers rely  on Medicaid for 43 percent of their revenue. And when you cut hundreds  of billions of dollars in Medicaid, you are significantly cutting back  on the access that millions of Americans will have to the primary  healthcare they desperately need.

At a time when the healthcare system in America is broken, when  primary healthcare is even in worse shape, this will make access to  primary healthcare even more difficult.

Some 22 percent of our seniors in this, the richest country on Earth,  are trying to survive on less than $15,000 a year. This legislation  will make it harder for seniors and people with disabilities to receive  the care they desperately need in nursing homes. Nursing homes in  Vermont--and I expect in every State in this country--are struggling.  They are understaffed. Workers there are underpaid. The quality, in  many cases, is not as good as it should be. But when Medicaid now  provides 60 percent of the revenue nursing homes rely on, slashing  Medicaid will make a disastrous situation even worse for some of the  most vulnerable people in our country.

Let us be clear. Let us not run away from it. Let us not double-talk  this issue and come up with all kinds of absurd rationalizations. This  legislation coming before the Senate this week is the most significant  attack on the  healthcare needs of the American people in the modern history of our  country.

And once again--once again--we are throwing millions of people off  the healthcare that they depend upon to stay alive in order to give tax  breaks to billionaires who have more wealth today than they will need  for a hundred lifetimes. And yet, oddly enough, despite the enormity of  what this legislation is about, not a single committee in the Senate  has held a single hearing on the impact this legislation will have. In  my view, really, this is absolutely irresponsible.

I am not quite sure why we continue to even have committees if the  Health and Labor Committee, of which I am ranking member, does not hold  a hearing on the most important piece of health legislation in the  modern history of this country. That is why this morning, I released,  as leader of the minority on the committee, a report discussing the  impact that this legislation would have on our Nation's healthcare  system. I did that by doing something pretty radical, I guess. We  actually reached out to healthcare providers all over the country.

If you are going to decimate American healthcare, you may want to  talk to the doctors and the nurses and the healthcare organizations  around America. I think that is kind of a commonsense thing to do.

Let me take this opportunity to thank the over 750 healthcare  providers from 47 States who responded to my request. I want to thank  them sincerely for their thoughtful responses. We basically said: What  is this legislation going to do in your State? And we got hundreds and  hundreds and hundreds of responses.

Executive Summary

The Senate is rushing to pass the largest cuts to federal       health care programs in the history of Medicaid and the       Affordable Care Act (ACA). The Republican budget bill, which       passed the House by only a single vote, would slash federal       health care programs by over $1 trillion. These cuts, along       with the elimination of tax credits for ACA coverage, will       take health care away from 16 million people. In some states,       such as Florida, Louisiana, Massachusetts, and Washington,       the Republican budget bill will nearly double the number of       people without insurance.

Remarkably, despite the major changes the Republican budget       bill would make to our health care system, the Senate is       moving towards passing the bill without a single hearing or       vote in Committee. No doctor, nurse, hospital, community       health center, or nursing home has been formally consulted to       help explain to the American people what these proposed       changes would actually mean.

This month, Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Ranking Member       of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and       Pensions (HELP), asked health care providers across the       country what this bill would mean for their patients. Over       750 health care providers from 47 states and the District of       Columbia shared their serious concerns.

HELP Minority Staff reviewed these submissions from health       care providers, as well as health policy research and other       publicly available information, to document how the       Republican budget bill would turn the crisis in American       health care into a national emergency.

Health care providers expressed deep concerns that the bill       would lead to more patients getting sick and dying; higher       health care costs as patients delayed preventative care and       visited more emergency rooms; and more hours spent on       paperwork. Taken together, higher costs and lower       reimbursement would cause providers to cut health services,       lay off clinical staff, and close facilities entirely. This       would impact everyone--not just those receiving health       coverage through Medicaid and ACA.

The responses included in the report represent a mere       fraction of the responses reviewed by HELP Minority Staff       raising concerns about the Republican health care cuts. Taken       together, doctors, nurses, hospitals, and providers are clear       about the immense harm the Republican health care cuts pose       to their patients. The consequences also extend well beyond       Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. As one California       doctor described it, ``If Medicaid collapses, the entire       health care system collapses.''

The American people should not be forced to lose their       health insurance--or pay higher premiums, higher copays, and       higher costs at the pharmacy counter--so that Republicans can       pay for tax breaks for the wealthy. Consider, for example,       that the one trillion-dollar cuts to health care in the bill       are nearly equivalent to the $1.1 trillion in tax breaks that       households above $500,000 will receive from the legislation.       Or that the bill provides tax breaks to more than 800,000       millionaire households, while ripping health insurance away       from 16 million people--a ratio of over 19 to 1.

When all the spending and tax cuts are put together, the       Penn Wharton Budget Model finds that the 40 percent of       Americans making $51,000 or less would see their taxes go up       in 2026 by hundreds of dollars, while those making at least       $4.3 million would see a tax cut of $390,000.

As one doctor from Maine notes: ``We have an existential       choice to make. The very wealthy want to steal from the less       wealthy       and poor Americans. We cannot allow that to happen. This       legislation must not pass.                                   Appendix

Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me just summarize and quote a small  number of the responses that we got. If this legislation were to be  signed into law, it would drive up the number of uninsured Americans in  every single State in this country.

For example, if this legislation was signed into law, the uninsured  rate in my State of Vermont would go from 3.3 percent to 6 percent. In  Louisiana, the uninsured rate would go from 6.7 percent to 12.4  percent. In the State of Washington, the uninsured rate would go up  from 6.2 to 11 percent. In Florida, the uninsured rate would go up from  10.4 percent to 18.8 percent, almost 19 percent of people in Florida  will be uninsured if this bill goes through. And this is true for every  State in the country--in many cases, almost doubling the number of  uninsured.

Let me just quote for you what healthcare providers and State  organizations around the country are saying as to the horrific impact  that this legislation would have. I know many of my Republican  colleagues get up and say it is not true; it is this, that, and the  other thing. Listen to the doctors, listen to the organizations, the  healthcare providers in your own State.

Let me just begin with Texas, a Dr. Audrey Nath, where the uninsured  rate will reach 20 percent. Anybody from Texas watching this, you are  going to be--if this bill goes through, you might want to say hello to  your Senators here. Your uninsured rate is going to go up to 20  percent.

This is what Dr. Audrey Nath wrote:

These cuts will cause rural hospitals in Texas to close       entirely. As a neurologist, I am terrified that the closest       hospital for many rural folks may then be hours away. During       an ischemic stroke, there is only 3 hours of precious time--

If you have a stroke, you have to get care very quickly. She writes  that ``the ``increased travel time may cause unnecessary cases of  paralysis and death.''

That is obviously what happens, not only with a stroke but for many  other illnesses if you don't have a hospital nearby.

Dr. Farhan Malik from Florida, where the uninsured rate will surge to  almost 19 percent, wrote:

Plainly said, children will die as a result of these cuts.       Hospitals will cut back on ICU doctors, doctors will leave       because of salary cuts, critical ancillary services will be       reduced and more medical students will avoid going into       pediatric residencies.

Dr. Mia Henderson, who works at a community health center in  Missouri, wrote that the cuts to Medicaid contained in this legislation  would mean that ``we may not be able to keep the doors open''--of the  community health center. ``We would potentially have to stop caring for  many of our patients.''

The Louisiana Rural Health Association wrote:

Louisiana's rural hospitals and healthcare providers are       already operating on razor-thin margins, struggling to keep       their doors open while serving some of our most medically       vulnerable communities. In Louisiana, 38 percent of hospitals       operate on negative margins and 27 percent are currently       vulnerable to closure. Medicaid cuts would worsen these       losses, putting more hospitals at risk of shutting down       entirely.

Dr. Sanjay Chaube, a doctor from Louisiana, told the HELP Committee:

The proposed cuts to Medicaid will cause untold hardship       and deaths among my patients. DON'T DO THIS!

He puts that in capital letters.

You don't want the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans       on your hands.

That is Dr. Chaube from Louisiana.

Dr. Gregory Omlor from Akron's Children's Hospital in Ohio told us:

If the proposed bill is passed and [my patients'] Medicaid       insurance is cut, it doesn't mean their asthma will go away.       It will mean that in most cases they will not receive       preventive care . . . [and][s]ome children will die of their       asthma.

And here is what another doctor from Ohio said:

Implementing work requirements into Ohio Medicaid will       threaten my patients' gains. Most of my patients WANT to       work--they are desperate to. There just aren't jobs available       for folks with very low skills and health conditions that       could cause them to miss work unexpectedly. The jobs that are       available do not pay enough for an adult to survive, and they       certainly don't offer health insurance. My patients who rely       on Medicaid have frequently been born into generational       poverty, have only had access to poor quality schools, and       live in neighborhoods where their health suffers.

And by the way, this Dr. Omlor talks about work requirements. Let us  understand that every single year millions and millions and millions of  Americans lose their jobs not through any fault of their own. The  company shuts down, company goes bankrupt, whatever it may be, they  lose their jobs. They don't have a job. How are they going to get  healthcare? We have taken healthcare away from them because they are  not working.

The Vermont Association of Hospitals--my own State--the Association  of Hospitals and Health Systems wrote that this bill ``reduces coverage  and access, particularly in rural areas such as Vermont where hospitals  and other health care providers are already financially fragile'' and  that it will force hospitals in Vermont to ``cut back on clinical  staff, services and care delivery.'' I can tell you hospitals in  Vermont are struggling. This will make a very, very difficult situation  even worse.

Now, I have got a radical idea, probably one that, I would say, 70 or  80 percent of the American people agree with, and that is maybe, just  maybe, instead of throwing 16 million people off of healthcare, instead  of creating a situation where 50,000 Americans die unnecessarily, why  don't we do what every other major country on Earth does and guarantee  healthcare to all people as a human right.

What about that?

Instead of throwing 16 million people off so we have almost 100  million uninsured, hey, why don't we do what Canada does, what the UK  does, what Spain does, what Finland does, what Holland does, what every  other major country on Earth does--guarantee healthcare to all people  as a human right.

But the problem there is it is easier to throw working people off of  their health insurance around here than to take on the Big Money  interests who run the insurance industry and the pharmaceutical  industry. That is what this is about.

In many respects, this bill represents exactly why many Americans are  giving up on democracy and have such contempt for Congress and for the  Democratic Party and for the Republican Party. At a time when the  richest people have never ever had it so good, they now see Republican  leadership working overtime to make the billionaire class even  wealthier. At a time when the majority of Americans are struggling to  put food on the table and pay for healthcare, they see Republican  leadership making life even more difficult for average Americans.

So I would say that I speak for the overwhelming majority of the  American people who think that it is basically insane that we are  talking about throwing 16 million people off of the healthcare they  have and creating a situation where 50,000 Americans will die  unnecessarily each year in order to give hundreds and hundreds and  hundreds of billions of dollars to billionaires and the wealthiest  people in this country. This is a disastrous, obscene piece of  legislation. It must be defeated.
