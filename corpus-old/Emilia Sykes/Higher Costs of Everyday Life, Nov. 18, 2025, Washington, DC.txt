Higher Costs of Everyday Life


Mrs. SYKES. Mr. Speaker, as families in Ohio's 13th Congressional  District get ready for the holiday season, I will talk about something  that is weighing on many of them.

The cost of everyday life keeps going up and people feel it every  time they shop for groceries, pay their utility bills, fill up their  gas tanks, or try to plan for the weeks ahead.

Across Ohio's 13th District, people are telling me the same thing:  Their paychecks are not stretching the way they used to and they are  working harder and getting less in return.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, food costs have  increased nearly 3 percent over the past year and the cost of meat,  poultry, fish, and coffee grew more than 5 percent.

The Department of Agriculture expects grocery prices to rise again  this year. These cost increases amount to grocery bills that are  hundreds of dollars higher for less food. This is compounded by the  SNAP cuts in the one big, ugly bill and cuts to food banks all across  this country.

However, it is not just food and groceries. Families are feeling the  squeeze in multiple ways. Healthcare premiums, copays, and prescription  costs have climbed, leaving families with difficult choices about their  care. Energy bills from heating homes in winter to cooling them in  summer are also rising, stretching budgets even further.

These are not small inconveniences. They shape every decision  families make about what they can afford. As people question whether  they can cover the basics, it affects how they plan their days, care  for one another, and participate in their communities. Something as  simple as sitting down together for a meal or planning a gathering can  become harder to manage.

These costs do not rise in a vacuum. The decisions made here in  Washington shape the choices people face at home. When policies put  pressure on working families instead of supporting them, the impact  shows up in higher bills and tighter budgets. A strong economy is one  that gives families the confidence to meet their needs and build toward  the future. It starts with people who feel secure enough to gather,  share a meal, and look ahead with some peace of mind.

That is why I continue to fight for policies that put people first. I  am working to lower healthcare costs. I am working to bring down  everyday expenses, including energy, utilities, and food costs. I am  committed to supporting the creation of good-paying jobs so families in  Ohio's 13th District and all across the country can worry a little less  and hope a lot more.

As we enter this holiday season, we should remember what keeps our  communities strong: fairness, opportunity, and support for one another.  Let us, as Members of Congress, make choices that help families meet  their needs and stay connected.                       Champion of the Week: Aarit Koul

Mrs. SYKES. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize Aarit Koul as the  champion of the week for Ohio's 13th Congressional District.

Aarit, a freshman at Jackson High School, recently won the 2025  National Civics Bee. He competed against finalists from 38 other States  in five rounds, including one in which he presented a societal problem  and offered his suggestions for solving it.

Aarit discussed the healthcare system in the United States, timely  and appropriate, especially considering our current state of affairs.

With this win comes a $100,000 college fund, which will go a long way  to help him attend his dream school, Yale University. Aarit aspires to  become a lawyer and ultimately land an appointment as a Justice of the  Supreme Court of the United States.

Mr. Speaker, this is not the first time I have come to the floor to  recognize Aarit's talents, nor is it the second. This is actually the  third time Aarit has been recognized before this body.

In 2023, he was the Congressional App Challenge Winner for Ohio's  13th District when he was in middle school. His app, Care Civics, was  designed to encourage young people to become civically engaged. He was  inspired by his time studying for the Ohio Civics Bee, which he went on  to win in 2024. Now, just a high school freshman, he has come out on  top at the national level, and I could not be more proud.

Mr. Speaker, I also had the honor of first meeting Aarit at Jackson  Memorial Middle School when he served as the Speaker of the Little  Congress. Aarit is a shining example of why Ohio's 13th Congressional  District is known as the birthplace of champions.

Mr. Speaker, I look forward to all that he accomplishes in the  future, and I thank Aarit for his dedication to civics in the United  States of America.
