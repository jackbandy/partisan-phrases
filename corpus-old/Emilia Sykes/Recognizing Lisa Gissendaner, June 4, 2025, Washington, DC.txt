Recognizing Lisa Gissendaner


Mrs. SYKES. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize Lisa Gissendaner,  who retired recently as the Canton Program Director for The Ohio State  University Young Scholars Program as this week's Champion of the Week  for Ohio's 13th Congressional District.

Throughout her career, Lisa helped and supported countless students  in Canton City Schools who aspired to be the first member of their  family to attend college.

Through her work, she has made a lasting impact on our community,  undoubtedly inspiring many more to strive for higher education.

The Young Scholars Program fosters generational change by instilling  a college-going culture in underserved areas, inspiring younger  siblings and peers to pursue higher education.

For her outstanding devotion, Lisa earned the respect and esteem of  many. In the wake of her departure, I know her numerous contributions  will not be forgotten. I am confident that her fine character and  decisive leadership will be sorely missed.

Again, I thank Lisa Gissendaner for her distinguished career serving  our community and congratulate her for being this week's 13th  Congressional District Champion of the Week.
