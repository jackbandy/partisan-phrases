Champions of the Week: Kaxten McGrew, Bastain Nowak, and Luke Hinkelman


Mrs. SYKES. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor Kaxten McGrew,  Bastian Nowak, and Luke Hinkelman as the winners of the 2025  Congressional App Challenge for our district and name them as Ohio's  13th Congressional District's champions of the week.

Their app, Eagle Express, is an innovative system that allows  students and teachers to better track and complete transactions within  their school's token-based incentive program. The app will help  teachers better manage students and students better manage their  finances.

Named after STEM High School's mascot, Beak Bucks allow teachers to  award points to students for positive behavior in the form of paper  money that they can redeem for prizes, but Kaxten, Bastian, and Luke  felt this was inconsistent and susceptible to forgery and fraud.

Their app, Eagle Express, establishes online wallets for students to  virtually track their Beak Bucks balances and redeem them for prize  rewards. Eagle Express also streamlines the process for teachers,  creating more efficient ways to track and allocate Beak Bucks.

Mr. Speaker, stories of innovation like these raise my spirits and  make me more optimistic for the future of our district and the rest of  the country.

Kaxten, Bastian, and Luke are impressive examples of what our  children can do when we invest in their futures and set them free to  explore their interests.

Mr. Speaker, I, once again, extend to them my congratulations for  being named 2025 App Challenge winners for Ohio's 13th Congressional  District. We cannot wait to see what the future holds for these three  young people.
