Recognizing the Remedy Church


Mrs. SYKES. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize The Remedy Church  and its congregation as Ohio's 13th Congressional District's Champion  of the Week.

This past weekend marked a significant milestone as The Remedy Church  celebrated 5 years of faithful service to God and community. Under the  leadership of Pastor Deante Lavender and Arnalesa Lavender,  affectionately known as Pastor Lav and Pastor Lesa, The Remedy Church  is dedicated to welcoming everyone from our community with open arms.

They are guided by the motto, Love Christ, Love People, Build  Community, and the mission to ``teach Christ boldly, love our city  deeply, and build lasting and strategic partnerships that transform  lives.''

Earlier this year, The Remedy Church moved to downtown Akron, further  establishing themselves in the greater Akron faith community. Their  reach goes beyond the church doors, as they have fed thousands, housed  hundreds, and ministered in prisons and throughout the community.

My husband, Kevin, and I recently had the pleasure of attending a  service at The Remedy Church, which was also their fifth anniversary.  We were moved by the enthusiastic spirit of fellowship, joy, and  genuine camaraderie that filled the sanctuary.

I sincerely congratulate Pastor Lav, Pastor Lesa, and The Remedy  Church congregation on their fifth anniversary. May they continue to  grow, serve, and be a blessing to both our community and the Lord and  Savior for years to come.
