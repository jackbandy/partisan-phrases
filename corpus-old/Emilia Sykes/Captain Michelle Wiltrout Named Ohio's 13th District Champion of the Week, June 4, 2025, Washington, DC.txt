Captain Michelle Wiltrout Named Ohio's 13th District Champion of the Week


Mrs. SYKES. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize Captain Michelle  Wiltrout, who retired this year from the Summit County Sheriff's  Office, as this week's Champion of the Week for Ohio's 13th  Congressional District.

For 32 years, Captain Wiltrout, dedicated her career to serving and  protecting the people of Summit County in a wide range of roles. Her  work has spanned the corrections division, the patrol division and  special operations, the detective bureau, and more.

In 2021, Captain Wiltrout earned the Taskforce Director position for  a State of Ohio Narcotics Taskforce, making her the first woman to run  a Narcotics Taskforce in the State of Ohio.

Just two years later, she was named 2023 Taskforce Commander of the  Year for her exceptional work and dedication in her role. She was also  the first woman to receive this honor in the State of Ohio.

While in charge of the Drug Unit, Captain Wiltrout introduced new  tools such as drone technology, and expanded the county's K9 unit from  one dog to eight.

Again, I want to thank Captain Michelle Wiltrout for her  distinguished career serving our community, and congratulate her on  being this week's Champion of the Week.
