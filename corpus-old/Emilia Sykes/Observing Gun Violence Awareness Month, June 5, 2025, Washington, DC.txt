Observing Gun Violence Awareness Month


Mrs. SYKES. Mr. Speaker, gun violence is a scourge that has plagued  the United States for far too long. We have witnessed tragedy after  tragedy, and the only thing that ever seems to happen is that gun  restrictions are loosened even further.

Six years ago, in my home State of Ohio, there was a mass shooting at  a bar in Dayton. Nearly 30 people were injured, and 10 were killed by a  man with a gun that he was able to legally modify through loopholes in  our gun laws.

Hundreds of people attended a vigil for the victims of this deadly  attack and demanded we do something. In response, the Governor of Ohio  signed permitless carry legislation, allowing individuals to carry  concealed firearms without a permit.

Last year, 25-year-old Megan Keleman, a young woman in my district,  was shot and killed in a Taco Bell drive-through. She was picking up  dinner for her family.

Why did Megan Keleman have to die that day? The system failed her.  The killer should have never had a gun.

Again, why did Megan Keleman have to die that day? She didn't.

Maybe if there were less cowardly people in office, Megan would be  alive, living out her path to serve and help other people. Her family  is working to make sure that there is change and to secure her legacy.

We have a duty as public servants to keep our communities safe, but  the inaction on gun violence is killing innocent Americans. We can and  must pass commonsense gun safety legislation to bolster background  checks and ban dangerous assault weapons.

The people of Ohio's 13th Congressional District sent me here to do  something about gun violence in our communities, and that is exactly  what I intend to do.

This is Gun Violence Awareness Month. This month, and every other  day, I mourn the lives of the countless people who have lost their  lives to senseless gun violence and those whom they have left behind.
