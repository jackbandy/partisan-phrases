Recognizing Rick Cotton for A Lifetime of Leadership


Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service and  enduring legacy of Mr. Rick Cotton, one of the most impactful  transportation leaders New York has ever known. His profound career  reflects an unwavering commitment to public service, visionary  leadership, and the belief that infrastructure can, and should, improve  the lives of millions.

Mr. Cotton earned an Artium Baccalaureus from Harvard College and a  Juris Doctorate from Yale Law School and served as a law clerk to  Justice William J. Brennan Jr., on the Supreme Court of the United  States. He brings a distinguished record of leadership across the  private sector, public service, and international affairs. Mr. Cotton  spent 25 years at NBC Universal, including 20 years as Executive Vice  President and General Counsel, and later served four years as President  and Managing Director of CNBC Europe. Earlier in his career, he served  the federal government as Executive Secretary at the United States  Department of Health, Education, and Welfare and as Special Assistant  for Renewable Energy at the United States Department of Energy. Across  every role, he demonstrated a  rare ability to navigate complexity while keeping the public interest  at the forefront.

Mr. Cotton later served as New York State's Special Counselor to the  Governor for Interagency Initiatives, where he helped advance some of  the state's most transformative infrastructure projects. These efforts  included the redevelopment of LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy Airports,  Moynihan Train Hall and the Penn Farley Complex, the new Tappan Zee  Bridge, the expansion of the Javits Center, and the Second Avenue  Subway. These projects not only modernized critical assets, but  reshaped how New Yorkers move, work, and connect across the region.

In 2017, Mr. Cotton was appointed Executive Director of the Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey. Under his leadership, the agency  confronted some of the region's most complex infrastructure challenges  and undertook one of the most ambitious capital programs in its  history. This included a $30 billion transformation of the region's  major airports and the full reconstruction of the Midtown Bus Terminal,  laying the foundation for world class transportation facilities built  for the 21st Century.

More than the projects completed or milestones reached, Mr. Rick  Cotton's legacy is reflected in the people he supported, the teams he  strengthened, and the standard of professionalism he brought to work.  His tenure will be remembered for its scale, its vision, and its  lasting impact on generations to come.
