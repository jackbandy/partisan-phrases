Gop Tax Scam Hurts Women and Families


Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. Speaker, the Republican cuts to  Medicaid jeopardize the lives of women and families across our country,  women like Kristen from my district.

Kristen suffers from Williams syndrome, which causes cardiovascular  issues and developmental delays. She receives care because of Medi-Cal.  Every 4 months, she must drive 2 hours to San Diego to run lab tests  and functions on her vital organs.

Despite these health concerns, Kristen works, volunteers in our  community, and dreams of owning a bakery, thanks to Medicaid. All of  that is endangered by this reconciliation bill.

I ask my Republican colleagues: Who are they to decide who gets the  care that people like Kristen need and depend on to survive? All of  these cuts are for what? So that billionaires and big corporations can  get even more handouts?

Let's stand with people like Kristen. Protect Medicaid and the  families who rely on Medicaid and got us to Congress.
