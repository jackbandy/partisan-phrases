Stopping Appropriation Work


Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on a  matter that is critical to the functioning of our government.

As House appropriators, we are tasked with ensuring that our Federal  agencies are properly funded so they can serve the American people.  However, we are being asked to perform this vital duty without even  knowing what plans DOGE has for the future of our agencies, let alone  the true role Elon Musk plays at DOGE and the rules it follows and  under what authority.

How can we, as lawmakers, fund the government and trust that our  instructions written into law are faithfully executed?

How can we make informed decisions that directly affect the lives of  millions of Americans who rely on these services?

We are being left in the dark without knowing about what plans DOGE,  OPM, and OMB have. The lack of transparency is alarming, unacceptable,  and illegal.

We need to end Elon Musk's power grab over agencies and services that  Americans depend upon before it is too late.

The Republic is in crisis, and Republicans need to wake up.
