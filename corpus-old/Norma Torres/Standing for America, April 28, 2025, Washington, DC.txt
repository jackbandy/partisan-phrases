Standing for America


Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to reflect on  the 100th day of Donald Trump's second term as President.

While some of my colleagues celebrate his actions, I am reminded why  I first ran for office and why I continue fighting for my community.

I was raised to believe that the United States of America was built  on the principles of liberty, democracy, and equal opportunity. For  more than two centuries, those ideals have guided us, creating a Nation  where everyone has the right to pursue their dreams, serve their  communities, and have a voice in their government without reprisals.

Today, we are witnessing something deeply troubling: the erosion of  the rule of law, the abandonment of democracy norms, and a betrayal of  the very values Americans of all backgrounds have long fought to  uphold.

On this 100th day of the 119th Congress, I stand firm in my belief  that: I, too, am an American. I, too, am a patriot. I, too, will  continue to defend the values and principles that made this country a  beacon of hope for the world.
