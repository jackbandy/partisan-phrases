Recognizing the Legacy of Juli Spitzer


Ms. HAGEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the legacy of my  friend and a great Wyomingite, Juli Spitzer. Juli never met a stranger,  and her life was defined by the love she had for her neighbors and the  communities she called home in Sublette and Teton Counties.

From the day Juli moved to Wyoming to attend the University of  Wyoming, she embraced the romance of the West. She loved the open range  and never tired of participating in the cowgirl life from baking bread  to moving cattle. Juli was particularly fond of the natural beauty and  wildlife we are blessed with in Wyoming.

Her fondness for the West led Juli to work towards preserving the  history and legacy of Wyoming, and Juli and her husband, Hort, were  long-time supporters and active members of the Sublette County  Historical Society and Jim Bridger League.

Through their shared commitment to telling the history and stories of  Wyoming, the Spitzers were influential in the inception and founding of  Wyoming's Museum of the Mountain Man, and both Juli and Hort would  later serve on the board of directors.

On a personal note, Juli Spitzer was truly one of a kind with a  personality as big as all outdoors.

She will be dearly missed by her husband, Hort; her friends; her  community; and all who knew her.

We take comfort in knowing that her legacy will be remembered for  generations by Wyomingites.
