Congratulating Frank Crum


Ms. HAGEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate  Laramie, Wyoming's very own Frank Crum for his performance and  touchdown in the Denver Broncos playoff win versus the Buffalo Bills  this past weekend.

As an offensive lineman, it is not often that Frank finds himself  open downfield. In fact, this was Frank's first reception and first  touchdown of his NFL career. Frank's touchdown is the result of an  unwavering work ethic and a commitment to excellence.

Following a commendable collegiate career at the University of  Wyoming, Frank went undrafted in the 2024 draft, but he did not let  that deter him. He signed with the Denver Broncos as an undrafted free  agent. Frank showed grit and determination, working his way up the  roster to become a key piece of the Denver Broncos' offensive line.

Frank's dedication and commitment paid off this weekend, as he scored  an iconic touchdown that was key in the Broncos' 33-30 victory.

Please join me in recognizing and celebrating the hard work and  successes of Wyoming's Frank Crum.
