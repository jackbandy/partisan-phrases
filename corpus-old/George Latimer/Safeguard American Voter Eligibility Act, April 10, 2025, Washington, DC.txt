Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act


Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Morelle for yielding me the  time.

Mr. Speaker, the American people in my district and in my State have  spoken clearly. This bill is voter suppression, pure and simple.

It is brought to us under the guise of stopping illegal voting. When  we analyze voting in Westchester County, where I was the county  executive for a million people, we found no appreciable illegal voting.

This is an opportunity for this majority to try to impose their will  on the States that they don't already control.

They want to end mail voter registration in my home State to satisfy  other States' regressive laws.

They want to require people who have voted legally for years to prove  their citizenship if they not only change their name but if they move.  A simple move requires them to drive to a county board of elections and  prove that they are an American citizen when they have proven that over  the course of 20 years or more of voting.

This bill subjects local officials to hefty criminal fines if they  register someone outside of these rules. This is an expensive unfunded  mandate in Westchester, New York City, and all the States involved.
