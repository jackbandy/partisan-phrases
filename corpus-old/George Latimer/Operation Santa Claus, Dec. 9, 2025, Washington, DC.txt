Operation Santa Claus


Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the charitable work in  Yonkers during this holiday season of Operation Santa Claus, raising  money to support organizations that work directly with individuals,  especially children with developmental disabilities.

The funds raised provide essential services, support, and adaptive  equipment during the holidays and throughout the year ahead.

The annual event fundraising is a breakfast to be held this Sunday,  December 14, in Castle Royale in Yonkers, where State Senator Nick  Spano is chairman with Tom Meier and Gail Burns as co-chairs.

We salute their good work and the individuals and groups honored at  this year's breakfast, including Dr. Iyad Annabi, who is receiving a  Lifetime Achievement Award.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate all involved.
