Protecting and Preserving Long Island Sound


Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, this week the House will vote on a bill to  reduce clean water standards, setting our country back in our fight for  clean water. I worked for three decades to improve the water quality in  the Long Island Sound. Having seen the progress we have made, I know  that we cannot stop our commitment now.

Just last week, I attended a roundtable with Long Island Sound  Citizens Advisory Committee to discuss how we in Congress can work with  them to preserve Long Island Sound. This roundtable built on an event  in Rye in June where a new 10-year conservation and management plan was  signed.

I have signed onto two bills. The first is the ESTUARIES Act that  will preserve Long Island Sound and 27 other estuaries of national  significance. The second is the Long Island Restoration and Stewardship  Act that reauthorizes grants made possible by the Clean Water Act  through fiscal year 2029.

We must keep clean water standards high in order to protect and  preserve our bodies of water. We may not get another chance.
