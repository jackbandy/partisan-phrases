President Trump's Tariff Policies


Mr. LATIMER. Madam Speaker, any day now, the Supreme Court will issue  a ruling on whether the President can impose tariffs under the  International Emergency Economic Powers Act.

President Trump's tariff policies have hurt America's small  businesses, who often cannot absorb the cost of higher duties. Now, the  economy is showing warning signs. Unemployment has risen to 4.6  percent, and small businesses shed 120,000 jobs in November alone.

That is why I recently joined 20 of my colleagues in sending a letter  to Treasury Secretary Bessent and Homeland Security Secretary Noem  urging both Departments to dedicate resources to planning for the  Supreme Court's decision. Proper planning is needed around an  information campaign for small businesses on how to navigate the tariff  protest process, ensuring that eligible tariff refunds are provided on  an expedited basis. Without a plan, the complexity and time needed to  pursue a refund will further burden small businesses.

I urge the Trump administration to work quickly to guarantee that  small businesses, the lifeline of our economy, are not left behind  because of this erratic policy.
