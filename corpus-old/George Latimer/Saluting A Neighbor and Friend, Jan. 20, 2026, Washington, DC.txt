Saluting A Neighbor and Friend, M. Christina Selin


Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and salute the  exceptional life of M. Christina Selin, known as Chris to all of her  friends, a resident of New Rochelle, and a tremendous community leader.

Chris is, by profession, a lawyer with a practice in business and  commercial law. She is an active member of the New Rochelle Bar  Association as part of that commitment to the law, but Chris' work goes  well beyond that.

She served for over a decade as a councilwoman on the New Rochelle  City Council, representing the city's South End, service as president  of the New Rochelle Public Library Foundation, active in her  neighborhood Sutton Manor Residents Association, and an ever-present  participant at major community events, like the summer concerts and all  of the other programs that always happened with Chris present and  participating.

In testimony to her community impact, she was named grand marshal for  the 2025 New Rochelle Thanksgiving Day Parade, the largest such parade  in the county, and she has received numerous awards and recognitions.

This week, Chris celebrates her 80th birthday at a soiree at Alvin &  Friends, the popular downtown New Rochelle establishment, where she  will be surrounded by friends and well-wishers.

Mr. Speaker, from the floor of the House of Representatives, we  salute this neighbor and friend who is making a tremendous contribution  every day to her profession and to her home community.
