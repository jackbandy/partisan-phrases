Small Businesses Bear Brunt of Immigration Enforcement Abuses


Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, every day I hear from small business owners  about the challenges of operating in this economy. In the past year,  small businesses have faced unrelenting attacks from this  administration on everything from tariffs to immigration enforcement.

According to a recent survey from the Small Business Majority, 47  percent of small business owners say that increased Federal immigration  enforcement has had a negative impact on their business. Many small  businesses have lost revenue or had to modify their operations because  employees and customers are afraid to come to work or to patronize  their business.

When masked ICE agents in full tactical gear inflict violence against  American citizens and then show up at businesses without identifying  themselves, small businesses pay the price.

Most businessowners support commonsense immigration reform to  modernize the legal immigration system to make it easier for qualified  workers to come into the U.S. legally, but in Minnesota, following the  tragic shootings, more than 60 Minneapolis-based business leaders  called for cooperation to de-escalate tensions and achieve durable  immigration reforms.

It is important for this body to hold Federal immigration officials  accountable and ensure that small businesses do not bear the brunt of  this administration's immigration enforcement abuses.
