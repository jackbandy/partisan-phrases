White Plains Social Security Hearing Office Closure


Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, the new administration, as it  indiscriminately cuts services, has announced that it will not keep the  Social Security Administration's hearing office in White Plains, New  York. Closing this hearing office with no local replacement is  unacceptable to the community it serves, and it covers multiple  congressional districts.

Seniors and people who are disabled come to this office from  Westchester and the other counties of the Hudson Valley to fight for  their benefits. With this closure, residents, likely on a fixed income,  will have to travel much longer distances: to Albany, to New Haven, or  to the south Bronx at greater expense, in some cases 4 hours one way on  public transit.

This is a financial and logistical hardship for people already  fighting for support. With the Westchester County government, my office  and I have identified sites in White Plains close to the current office  that are available. This would keep government services in the  community where it belongs.

Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge the new administration to reconsider  driving constituents away from convenient services and to work with  Members from New York State to find a solution before May.
