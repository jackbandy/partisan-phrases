Recognizing At Home on the Sound


Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the outstanding  contributions made by At Home on the Sound to benefit senior citizen  residents of Larchmont and Mamaroneck. Tonight, they are celebrating  their 15th anniversary with their Crystal Celebration. I can't be there  in person, but we are there in spirit.

At Home provides a support system to help seniors continue to enjoy a  vibrant lifestyle as they age--able to remain in their homes and highly  active. At Home volunteers and professionals deliver a monthly schedule  of educational programs, active discussion groups, social gatherings,  and the necessary transportation.

When I retire, not that long from now, I know exactly where I can go  to learn how to paint and play bridge, canasta, mahjong, and a host of  other recreations.

At Home on the Sound complements the already active senior recreation  programs offered by the Village of  Larchmont, the Village of Mamaroneck, and the town of Mamaroneck,  providing a complete menu of services and programs for those 60-plus  years of age in our area.

I congratulate them on 15 great years. The best is yet to come.
