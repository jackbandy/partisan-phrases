Recognizing Reverend William E. Norman, Sr.


Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, I recognize the achievements of Reverend  William E. Norman, Sr., celebrating his 30th year of pastoral service  to the congregants of SolidRock Christian Center of Yonkers, New York.

Reverend Norman has led the church in spiritual matters, Sunday  worship services, and weekly Bible study classes, in person and online.

His service to the larger community extends to his efforts to meet  the needs of the poor and the hungry, young people and seniors, the  homeless, and those in need of mental health services.

Pastor Norman serves the city of Yonkers as director of Veteran  Services, commissioner for the city's Human Rights Commission, as a  member of the Yonkers Auxiliary Police, and as a police chaplain for  the Yonkers Police Department.

He has served with distinction as a United States Marine for 4 years  on Active Duty and 2 years in the Reserves. A native of North Carolina  with roots in Brooklyn, Pastor Norman is a longtime Yonkers resident  and leader. With his wife, Reverend Tamara Norman and four children,  including Councilwoman Deana Norman, he has charted a vision for future  community development that would serve all, combining housing,  childcare, recreation, social services, and worship.

Mr. Speaker, we salute Reverend William Norman for his years of  service in spiritual and secular realms, all that benefits the people  of the city of Yonkers.
