Alberta, Canada


Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, it is reported that members of the Trump  administration have held meetings with representatives of a group from  the Province of Alberta that want to break away from Canada and form  their own nation.

Why any American government would give aid and comfort to a group  that would divide and destabilize an ally and peaceful neighbor like  Canada is beyond reality.

Yet, those who speculate we should invade and take Greenland by force  are operating with Vladimir Putin's ambition to create some illegal and  unholy American empire fueled by ideology to force Canada as well into  submission to America.

Making common cause in any way with those who would destroy the  Canadian nation reminds me of Germany's efforts to encourage Mexico to  attack the United States during World War I.

Do we really think in our competition with China and Russia that  alienating Canada and Europe is smart geopolitics? No. It is stupidity,  letting arrogance blind us from rational policies. Stop before we do  permanent damage too great to fix.
