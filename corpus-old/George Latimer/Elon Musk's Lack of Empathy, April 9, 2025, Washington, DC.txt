Elon Musk's Lack of Empathy


Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, Elon Musk said recently in a Joe Rogan  podcast: ``The fundamental weakness of Western civilization is  empathy.'' He further said that empathy has been ``weaponized.''

This is consistent with his statement that Social Security is a Ponzi  scheme, not the program that has saved the lives and the livelihood of  countless Americans. This is the philosophy of the world's richest man,  Elon Musk.

Let me contrast that philosophy with that which was expressed in  Matthew 25:

``For I was hungry, and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty  and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you took me in, I was naked  and you clothed me, I was sick and you ministered to me, I was in  prison, and you visited me.

``Then the righteous will answer, `Lord, when did we see you hungry,  thirsty, a stranger, naked, sick or in prison?' And he will answer,  `When you did this for the least of my brothers, you did it for me.' ''

Empathy: Not the weakness of Western civilization; the bedrock of  Western civilization.
