Attacks on Library of Congress


Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, President Trump fired the Librarian of  Congress just 1 year shy of completing her 10-year term. He also fired  the head of the U.S. Copyright Office, replacing them with his former  lawyers and current DOJ appointees. While the President may get to  appoint the Librarian, these offices are under the jurisdiction of  Congress, and we should be consulted.

I have raised concerns about troubling patterns that we have seen  emerging in our country, patterns that echo tactics of regimes in  Hungary, North Korea, and Venezuela. These are not governments we  admire. Yet, this latest move fits that mold.

The Library of Congress is the world's largest library and a symbol  of our commitment to free thought. We have seen growing attacks on  libraries and books nationwide. Now it seems even the Library of  Congress is not off limits.

While personnel were fired, this is about power, who controls what  Americans read, learn, and dream. When you limit access to knowledge,  you limit freedom. You send a clear message that questioning authority  is no longer welcome.

The slide away from democracy continues.
