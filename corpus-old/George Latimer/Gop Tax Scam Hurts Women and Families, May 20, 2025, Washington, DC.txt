Gop Tax Scam Hurts Women and Families


Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, in just a few hours, the Rules Committee  will be making the final touches to America's worst budget ever. They  are doing it in the middle of the night to hide the fact that this bill  will make Americans sicker and poorer.

Take SNAP, the most effective antipoverty tool we have. This bill is  the deepest cut to food assistance in history, making it harder to put  food on the table for seniors, families, and veterans, including 74,000  people in my district.

Vivian, in New Rochelle, said: I have been delivering food to seniors  and people in need since 2009. I do this every day because I know what  it is like to be in need myself. I had to stop working when I was  diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and now I rely on SNAP, and it is  still not enough. If those benefits are cut, it would be devastating.

Republicans are taking food assistance and healthcare away from those  who need it the most to give tax breaks to those who need them the  least.

Try to spin it any way you want. Everyday Americans will suffer.
