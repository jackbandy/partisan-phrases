Tariffs Whack Trump Voters


Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, the Republicans are trumpeting the dawn of  a golden age of economic growth. However, this week, The Wall Street  Journal had an editorial, ``Trump's Tariffs Whack Trump Voters'' with a  subhead of ``Whatever happened to GOP concern for the working class?''

The Wall Street Journal said: ``President Trump won the Presidency a  second time by promising working-class voters he'd lift their real  incomes. Which makes it all the more puzzling that he's so intent on  imposing tariffs that will punish those same Americans.''

The Wall Street Journal said: ``Tariffs are taxes, and Mr. Trump's  latest tariffs are estimated to be about an annual $150 billion tax  increase. Taxes are antigrowth. That is the message investors are  sending this week since Mr. Trump let his 25 percent tariffs on Canada  and Mexico take effect.''

The Wall Street Journal said: ``Brace for higher prices on berries,  bell peppers, and . . . beer. Target CEO Brian Cornell told CNBC . . .  that tariffs on Mexico may force the company to raise prices on fruits  and vegetables.''

The Wall Street Journal said all of these things, Mr. Speaker. I  couldn't have said it better myself.
