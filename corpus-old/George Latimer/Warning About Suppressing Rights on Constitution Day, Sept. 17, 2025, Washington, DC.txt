Warning About Suppressing Rights on Constitution Day


Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, today, we celebrate the 238th birthday of  the U.S. Constitution, and we reflect on the document that enshrines  the freedoms that we hold dear.

At the heart of those freedoms is the First Amendment, the right to  free speech. It protects popular speech and speech that challenges,  provokes, and offends. That is the point.

This week, the Attorney General said that the Department of Justice  would ``absolutely target you, go after you'' for so-called hate  speech, a dangerous misreading of the Constitution. Though she has  since walked it back, the message was clear: This administration would  rather silence dissent than defend liberty.

I hear defense of the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms, but I  want to make sure that we defend all amendments, including the Fifth  Amendment for due process, and the 10th Amendment, rights that are  reserved for the States and the people from the Federal Government.

Our rights don't come with an asterisk. We don't surrender the First  Amendment or any others to political convenience.

On this Constitution Day, let us remember the greatest threat to  democracy is not exercising our rights. It is the effort to suppress  those rights.
