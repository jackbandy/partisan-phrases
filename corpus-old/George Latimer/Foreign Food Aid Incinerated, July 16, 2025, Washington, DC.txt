Foreign Food Aid Incinerated


Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, this week The Atlantic reported that the  Trump administration is planning to incinerate $800,000 worth of high- nutrition biscuits, food that was meant for starving children in  Afghanistan and Pakistan.

These are not snacks. These are fortified, lifesaving meals. It gets  worse. The administration will spend $130,000 just to destroy them.  These are resources that could feed children anywhere in the world  instead of going up in smoke.

This is more than wasteful. It is cruel. It is part of a broader,  draconian foreign policy that puts ideology ahead of humanity. The  administration has made it clear that it will not send out aid until  countries vote in a certain way or make trade deals.

The Trump administration claims it is putting America first, but  these policies put America last. When we offer food aid, we are not  just fighting hunger, we are building goodwill. We are preventing  famine. We are strengthening global stability and reducing the risk of  conflict. That is what soft power looks like. When we abandon it, we  abandon our values, our influence, and our moral leadership in this  world.
