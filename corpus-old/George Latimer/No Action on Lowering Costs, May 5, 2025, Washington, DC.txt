No Action on Lowering Costs


Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, I have been a Member of this body for just  over 120 days. It was clear in November that the American people voted  for their family economics. They wanted to see lower costs.

Mr. Speaker, I am perplexed that this House has yet to vote on any  legislation that lowers costs for the average family. In fact, we will  be voting this week on a bill that renames the Gulf of Mexico.

No one is clamoring for a newly named body of water. They want lower  grocery bills. House Republicans' proposals to cut Medicaid and SNAP to  pay for tax breaks for billionaires will make life more, not less,  expensive for people in Westchester and the Bronx.

The President's thoughtless red light-green light tariffs are making  it harder and more expensive to import goods. Those increased costs are  paid for by Americans, not foreign countries.

Mr. Speaker, instead of mind-bending tariffs, giveaways to  billionaires, and renaming bodies of water, we should be voting on  bills that lower costs for the average family. I know many of my  colleagues agree. Let's get to real work on behalf of our constituents.
