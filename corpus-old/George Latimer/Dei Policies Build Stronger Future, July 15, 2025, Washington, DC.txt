Dei Policies Build Stronger Future


Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, this administration's open hostility to  programs involving diversity, equity, and inclusion is built on deep- seated prejudices that have no basis in constitutional principles,  economic realities, or morality.

Our Constitution has been amended specifically to advance inclusion,  equity, and diversity, granting freedom to Black Americans from slavery  and ensuring their right to vote, and establishing the right of women  and those over 18 to vote, as well--free speech, assembly, and  religious practices for all.

Economic growth recognizes the buying power of all of our citizens  and the rising tide that allows women, people of color, and those of  every demographic to grow businesses and buy services and products that  expand our economy and make us competitive in worldwide markets.

Then, there is the morality of helping others. The Good Samaritan  stopping by the roadside to help a beaten stranger not of his own  religion is a testament to: ``Who is my neighbor?'' It is not just the  person who shares my skin color.

Policies to eliminate all DEI efforts are a vestige of the prejudiced  past, not a prescription for a stronger future America.
