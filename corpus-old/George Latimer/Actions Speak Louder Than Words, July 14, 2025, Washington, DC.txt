Actions Speak Louder Than Words


Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, today President Trump announced that the  U.S. will provide NATO allies with weapons to send to Ukraine. Finally.  This is welcome news, but it comes 6 months late.

Wasn't it candidate Trump who promised to end this war on day one?  How many Ukrainian lives might have been saved if he had kept that  promise?

President Trump also announced that Putin has 50 days to agree to a  cease-fire or face ``very severe tariffs.''

On May 28, the President gave Putin 2 weeks to show a willingness to  end the war in Ukraine. That was 6 weeks ago. Now the deadline has been  extended. The future of Ukraine and its people hangs in the balance.

Actions speak louder than words. Ukraine has been subjected to  tariffs. Russia has not. It is time this administration stood up to  Putin with the same level of rhetoric used to insult Canada and  Denmark. We can't afford any more of these deadlines that keep getting  pushed and hollow threats. Months ago, we called on this government to  side with the victim, Ukraine. Let's back it up with deeds.
