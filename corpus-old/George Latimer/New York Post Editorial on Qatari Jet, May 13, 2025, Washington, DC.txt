New York Post Editorial on Qatari Jet


Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the New York Post Editorial  Board wrote about President Trump's plans to accept a free gift from  Qatar of a $400 million Boeing 747-8 jet.

The New York Post said: ``What is President Trump thinking? He's  bragging of winning a $400 million `gift,' a `palace in the sky' . . .  from Qatar that, in effect, he'll eventually own personally.

``Sorry, this `gift' is from far free; Qatar will surely expect  something in return.

``And the optics are beyond awful, especially as Congress mulls  hundreds of billions in Medicaid cuts.''

The New York Post continues: ``That not only looks bad; it creates  all kinds of conflicts of interest and runs smack into the  Constitution's Emoluments Clause, which prohibits foreign gifts.''

The Post Editorial closes: `` . . . but given all the foreign  investments and conflicts of interests--and now a $400 million plane-- they seem designed to benefit the President more than anything.''

This from the New York Post editorial board. I couldn't have said it  better myself.
