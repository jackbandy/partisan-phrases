Recognizing Co-Op City Times


Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, in a world where local news services-- newspapers and radio stations--are disappearing on a frightening level,  it is important to recognize and salute those organizations that are  continuing to provide information about our localities, the lives and  times of the individuals of our communities.

In the Bronx--specifically, in Co-op City--we have a public debt of  gratitude that we owe to the Co-op City Times, which is serving the  40,000-plus people who reside there.

Owned and operated by the Riverbay Corporation, the Co-op City Times,  led by Rozaan Boone, editor-in-chief, and her team of reporters, covers  the work of the Co-op Board of Directors and the many organizations of  Co-op City, from the NAACP branch to The American Legion post and every  other group in between.

The Co-op City Times provides weekly news, free of charge, that  covers the events and information of the individual building  organizations, local arts and performances, and the churches and houses  of worship and all of their events, and they spotlight the persons and  the personalities that move Co-op City every day.

I thank Co-op City Times from the floor of the House of  Representatives for showing that local news can still be vocal news.
