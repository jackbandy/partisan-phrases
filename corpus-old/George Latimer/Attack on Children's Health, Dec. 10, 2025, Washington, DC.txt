Attack on Children's Health


Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to  Secretary Kennedy and the Trump administration's most recent attack on  our children's health.

On Friday, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the  panel of anti-vaxxers that Secretary Kennedy put in charge, upended  over three decades of precedent on hepatitis B vaccine recommendations  for babies.

Secretary Kennedy's fascination with quackery has, once again, set  health, science, and medicine in America backward.

The new guidance says that only babies whose mothers test positive  for hepatitis B or whose status is unknown should receive the vaccine.

For every other baby, the committee has decided not to give a  recommendation.

If acting CDC Director O'Neil approves this recommendation, countless  babies will be at risk of liver disease and other long-lasting health  issues.

Mr. Speaker, I call on the administration to reject this unscientific  and reckless proposal before it harms our children.
