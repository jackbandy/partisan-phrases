Trump's 100 Days


Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, 100 days: irresponsible tariff imposition,  confusing businesses, and tanking the stock market; illegal seizure of  citizens without judicial process; dramatic cuts to the delivery of  Social Security benefits and veteran benefits; abandoning environmental  protections for clean air and clean water; destabilizing families,  hospitals, and nursing homes with pending Medicaid cuts; and siding  with a ruthless aggressor, Russia, rather than the victim, Ukraine.

Mr. Speaker, 100 days: exonerated violent criminal behavior from the  January 6 insurrection; unethical efforts to end investigations on  allies and donors; firing talented, career-committed professionals and  replacing them with blind loyalists; insulting Canada, Mexico, Denmark,  and the European Union; disruption of programs; threats to  universities, law firms, State and local governments, the Federal  workforce, and the media; and threats to elected officials.

The American people gave the MAGA movement a narrow majority 6 months  ago, but now they are having second thoughts. There is no golden age  ahead, just a recession. Contrast this with Franklin Delano Roosevelt,  who, in 100 days, saved America.
