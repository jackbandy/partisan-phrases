Which Elon Musk to Believe


Mr. LATIMER. Mr. Speaker, which Elon Musk should we believe?

In February, he called the U.S. Agency of International Development,  USAID, ``corrupt'', ``beyond repair,'' and ``a ball of worms'' that  needs to be eliminated. He claimed that there is a ``gigantic fraud  loophole'' where government funds given to NGOs lack sufficient  oversight.

In March, Elon Musk called Social Security ``the biggest Ponzi scheme  of all time,'' and policy followed his comments.

Then this week he said that: ``If the massive deficit spending  continues, there will only be money for interest payments and nothing  else: no Social Security, no medical, no defense, nothing.''

This week he said about the big, ugly bill: ``I am sorry, but I just  can't stand  it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled congressional  spending bill is a disgusting abomination.''

Which Elon Musk do you believe? The erratic rhetoric and policies of  this administration are becoming clear to all who watch.
