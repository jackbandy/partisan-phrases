Fired By President Trump


Ms. RIVAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to share the story of a Federal  scientist from California who, in their words, was fired by President  Trump and Elon Musk.

They wrote:

I was a Pathways student intern at the EPA. I was assisting       and training under the ecotoxicology group studying the       effects and bioaccumulation of PFAS. I am completely       devastated and heartbroken.

The EPA Pathways Program creates a pathway to a career in the Federal  Government for students and recent graduates. In this case, this is a  student working on complex scientific issues involving PFAS, toxic  chemicals that are all around us.

As the only Latino Member with a STEM background in Congress, I know  how important it is to encourage our students and young professionals  to pursue careers in STEM.

Firing our future STEM workforce just as they are getting started in  their careers is shortsighted and irresponsible. These firings will  decimate the future Federal STEM workforce that will keep American  innovation competitive.
