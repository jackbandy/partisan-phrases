Benjamin Guerrero-Cruz is Home


Ms. RIVAS. Mr. Speaker, for months I have been sharing the story of  Benjamin Guerrero-Cruz, a constituent of mine who is a senior in high  school. He was detained by ICE in August while walking his dog.

In the span of 24 hours, ICE shuffled Benjamin between detention  centers and across State lines without his family knowing. I visited  Benjamin at the Adelanto Detention Center and observed a recent court  hearing of his, and my team has been working with his family on this  case throughout the ordeal.

Today, I am excited and relieved to report that after months of  living through a nightmare, Benjamin is home. My heart goes out to his  family, especially his mother, who can hold her son again after months  of fear and uncertainty at the hands of ICE. No family should ever have  to live through this.

I will continue showing up to detention facilities to hold ICE and  this administration accountable for the terror that they are forcing  families to live through each day.

Mr. Speaker, I am glad that Benjamin is home, and I hope he and his  family can begin the healing process.

Welcome home, Benjamin.
