Ice is Out of Control


Ms. RIVAS. Mr. Speaker, ICE is out of control. Everyone needs to know  the nightmare that is unfolding for my constituent and his family.

Last month, ICE detained Benjamin Guerrero-Cruz while he was walking  his dog. Benjamin is a rising senior and in Junior ROTC at Reseda High  School. He is a kid who wants to serve our community. He has been in  ICE detention for the past month, separated from his family and  friends.

Last week, ICE transferred Benjamin from California to Arizona. Less  than 24 hours later, Benjamin was slated to be transferred again to  Louisiana but was instead sent back to California. This all occurred  without his family knowing.

This is why I introduced the INFORM Act. The INFORM Act brings  transparency to ICE's decisionmaking process and fights for the dignity  of detainees.

When I visited the Adelanto Detention Facility to get answers into  ICE's decisionmaking process, ICE blocked me. I will keep fighting and  seeking justice for Benjamin, his family, and all immigrants.
