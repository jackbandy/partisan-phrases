Recognizing Congressional Patriot Award Recipient Punk Carter


Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Punk Carter of  Celina, Texas, and present him with the Congressional Patriot Award.  Punk has dedicated himself to faithfully serving our community.

Originally from Sherman, Texas, Punk moved with his family to Celina  and graduated from high school there in 1965. From a young age, he  worked on a ranch to train cutting horses and participated in numerous  cutting horse competitions. Punk is currently a director at large for  the National Cutting Horse Association, where he previously served as  an executive board member and president. For his outstanding  contributions to the cutting horse industry, Punk was inducted into the  National Cutting Horse Members Hall of Fame and the Texas Cowboy Hall  of Fame. He was also voted as Celina's Citizen of the Year in 2010 and  given the Key to the City in 2022.

In addition, Punk is passionate about helping individuals of all ages  from around the world learn about equines, as they are incredible  companions. He serves as a 4A judge at cutting competitions and has  earned numerous trophies and awards over the years for his expertise  and skill in the cutting horse profession. Punk has also won a state  cutting horse event alongside his daughter on Father's Day, making them  the first father and daughter champion duo on that special occasion. I  am pleased to recognize Punk for his dedication to serving our  community and being an upstanding leader to those around him.

It is an honor to bestow Punk with the Patriot Award for his  exceptional service to the people of North Texas.
