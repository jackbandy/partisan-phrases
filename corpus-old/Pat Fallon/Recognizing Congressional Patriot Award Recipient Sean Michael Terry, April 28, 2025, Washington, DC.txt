Recognizing Congressional Patriot Award Recipient Sean Michael Terry


Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Sean Michael  Terry of Pilot Point, Texas, and present him with the Congressional  Patriot Award. Sean has dedicated himself to faithfully serving our  community.

A native of Gunter, Sean earned his bachelor's degree in Agricultural  Economics from Texas A&M University and began his career as a claims  adjuster for State Farm Insurance and equipment salesman. For over 25  years, he has distinguished himself through public service as a  volunteer firefighter, councilmember, and Mayor of the City of Celina.  Sean has also served as President of the North Texas Mayors Association  and board member of the Celina Rodeo Foundation Board. In addition, he  has been the Vice President of Entitlements for Centurion American  Development Group since 2013. Under his leadership as Celina's mayor,  the city experienced remarkable economic growth and investments. Sean  also led the effort to connect all Celina residents to high-speed  internet, which led to Celina's recognition as the first Gigabit City  in Texas.

For his outstanding contributions and service, Sean has earned  numerous accolades, including the Outstanding Leader Award from the  City of Celina, the Community Builder Award, and the Celina Varsity  Cheer Parent of the Year Award. He has also been recognized by the  Celina Fire Department and received a proclamation from the Collin  County Commissioners Court for the State of Texas. Sean's leadership  and community advocacy have made a profound impact on the City of  Celina and the North Texas region. I am pleased to recognize him today  for his unwavering dedication to public service, and I wish him  continued success.

It is an honor to bestow Sean with the Patriot Award for his  exceptional service to the people of North Texas.
