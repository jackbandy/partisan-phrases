Recognizing Congressional Patriot Award Recipient Ralph O'dell


Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Ralph O'Dell  of Celina, Texas, and present him with the Congressional Patriot Award.  Ralph has dedicated himself to faithfully serving our community and  country.

Ralph is a veteran of the Second World War and served with the United  States Army from 1943 to 1946. He participated in the South Pacific  campaign, and after being honorably discharged, he joined the Army  Reserves in 1948 where he remained until 1985. For his distinguished  service, Ralph has received the Meritorious Service Medal, the Southern  Philippine Islands Campaign with one Bronze Star, the Philippine  Liberation Medal and Ribbon with one bronze Star, and many more  commendations.

In addition to his military service, Ralph has continued to be a  fierce advocate for American values and a dedicated community  volunteer. He served as the President of Oak Cliff Junior Chamber of  Commerce and was a member of Rotary International, the Texas Silver- Haired Legislature, the Reserve Officers Association, Veterans of  Foreign Wars, and the American Legion. Ralph also assisted with  Salvation Army and Red Cross drives to support those in need. As a  result of his outstanding work, he was recognized as Celina's Citizen  of the Year several times and received the Key to the City from  Celina's mayor. Moreover, the Ralph O'Dell Senior Center in Celina has  been established in recognition of Ralph's decades of service as a  senior center coordinator. He is also a man of faith, and he regularly  attends First Methodist Church in Celina. I am pleased to recognize  Ralph today for being an upstanding American patriot and his  ongoing pursuit for freedom, strength, and integrity in our Nation.

It is an honor to bestow Ralph with the Patriot Award for his  exceptional service to the people of North Texas.
