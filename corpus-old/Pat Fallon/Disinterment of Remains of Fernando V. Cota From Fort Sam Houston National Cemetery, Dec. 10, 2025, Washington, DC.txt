Disinterment of Remains of Fernando V. Cota From Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery, Texas


Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair and ranking member for  their leadership. They did a wonderful job on this.

Mr. Speaker, this NDAA contains substantial wins for servicemembers  and their families. It continues the committee's tradition of improving  the quality of life of servicemembers and their families by authorizing  a 3.8 percent pay raise, expanding childcare, increasing family  separation allowances, expanding and reauthorizing special pays and  bonuses, and expanding convalescent leave.

This bill also bans cell phones in DODEA schools, prevents the  downsizing or closing of childcare centers without congressional  notification, expands access to healthcare, prevents the elimination of  uniformed  doctors, increases access to specialty care, and authorizes over $335  million to renovate and build new medical centers, hospitals, and  clinics.

More importantly, this bill puts the final nail in the coffin of the  Biden DOD's woke bureaucracy. The FY 2026 NDAA includes essential  reforms that we all know are essential to refocus our military on  warfighting and lethality by codifying the President's executive order  of ending radical and wasteful government diversity, equity, and  inclusion, better known as DEI, programs and preferencing; eliminating  statutory provisions relating to DEI in the Department of War; and  requiring all command selections to be based--wait for it--on  individual merit and demonstrative performance rather than race,  ethnicity, or sex. Those categories would be immaterial.

Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of this bipartisan NDAA so we can  deliver on our promises to servicemembers and their families, making  our warfighters lethal, better trained, and more prepared for the  future fight, while ensuring their quality of life is the standard  Americans expect us to provide their brave warriors.
