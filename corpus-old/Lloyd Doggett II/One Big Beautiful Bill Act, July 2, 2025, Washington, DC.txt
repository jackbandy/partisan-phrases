One Big Beautiful Bill Act


Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, at 3:35 in the morning, a favorite time of  Republicans for taking up this bill, we consider a travesty.

The Senate took an ugly bill, went out and whipped it with an ugly  stick, and made it even uglier with 17 million Americans going without  health insurance; a 17 percent increase in electric rates; and the  largest nutritional assistance cut in American history, leaving  Americans hungry.

The independent Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget condemns  this as exploding our debt, spiking it to new record highs, and  accelerating the insolvency of Social Security and Medicare.

One thing remains the same: It takes from those with the least and  gives to those with the most, lining the pockets of the super-rich with  millions in tax giveaways.

It is mean. It is cruel. It is wrong. That is why it is being taken  up at this hour of the morning, as they have done throughout this  process.

Let's reject this ugly bill and stand up for Americans.
