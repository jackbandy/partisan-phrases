War for Oil


Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, unable to run America, Trump says that he  will run Venezuela.

Unwilling to provide help to Americans facing soaring health  premiums, he offers new tax subsidies to Big Oil.

Long eager to drag America back to the ugly glory days of White  nationalism under his hero, President William McKinley, Trump now is  apparently going to make imperialism great again, also.

Declaring that he and he alone will dominate the Western Hemisphere,  he sends a chilling message to his fellow authoritarians, like Putin,  Xi, and others: Might makes right. Just stay in your own neighborhood.

With no interest in democracy, he has made clear that this is a war  for oil and that he will work with any pawn that will get it to him,  even those who are launching a new wave of repression in Venezuela.

Colombia, Mexico, Greenland--he is handing Putin a gift by dividing  NATO. Our allies had to meet yesterday to defend Denmark on Greenland  from this bully in chief.

So many conflicts but no plan to provide security to American  families. He ignores our needs.
