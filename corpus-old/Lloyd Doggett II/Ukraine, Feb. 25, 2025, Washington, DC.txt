Ukraine


Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, Putin and Trump: a dictator and a wannabe,  and another destroyed Ukrainian city. Thousands have been murdered and  thousands of children have been kidnapped. Trump disgracefully voted  yesterday with North Korea and Russia to blame the murdered, not the  murderer.

Trump is joining a rogues' gallery of lesser dictators to deny  Putin's murderous invasion, his war crimes, and a demand that he return  occupied Ukrainian territory. Trump, ``the great appeaser,'' is joined  in this appalling wrong by House Republican accomplices.

While Ukrainians dodge bullets and missiles and are risking death  daily, most of the House Republicans seem scared into silence by the  threat of a very mean Trump tweet. By its silence, this Republican  white flag surrender caucus is emboldening our adversaries to replace  the world order established by both Democratic and Republican leaders  since World War II.

If we fail Ukraine, our democratic ally, we fail the rule of law.  Let's unite to resist the appeasement of Putin and seek a victory for  self-determination, democracy, and freedom.
