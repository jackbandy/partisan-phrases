Supporting Pregnant and Parenting Women and Families Act


Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, in their incessant drive to impose a  national ban on all forms of abortion, Republicans continue to block  relief for millions of Americans who are struggling with soaring  ObamaCare health insurance premiums. Now, today, they offer this bill  to funnel taxpayer dollars to fake health clinics.

To deceive women, these so-called pregnancy crisis centers use  medical jargon and dress up in scrubs, yet most of the 2,600 clinics do  not have a single licensed medical professional. Instead, they rely on  fear and misinformation to discourage vulnerable women as they are  trying to make one of the most important healthcare decisions about  what is best for them.

Much more shocking than the waste that is promoted through this bill  is the indifference with which so many extremist Republicans have shown  to the right to life, the right to life for the mother, the right to  life for American women.

I chaired an Austin field hearing last August, and I heard dozens of  tragic stories from Texas women like Kaitlyn Kash and Amanda Zurawski,  forced to the brink of death before they could receive care for a  miscarriage, hemorrhage, or sepsis.

An obstetrician, Dr. Donell Oliver, testified: ``Women are dying;  families are suffering; and medical professionals' hands are being  tied.'' That is the result of the kind of strict abortion ban  Republicans have imposed on Texas women that some here want to impose  on all 50 States and all women in our country.

I think the death certificates for so many other women who have been  denied treatment for pregnancy complications should really read the  truth, which is ``Cause of Death: Republican abortion ban.''

For every American whose life is threatened by Republican extremist  interference, I strongly oppose this bill and urge its rejection.
