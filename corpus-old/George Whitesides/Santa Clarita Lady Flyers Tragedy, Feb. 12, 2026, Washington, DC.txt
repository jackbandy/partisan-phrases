Santa Clarita Lady Flyers Tragedy


Mr. WHITESIDES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share the heartbreaking  and inspiring story of the Santa Clarita Lady Flyers, a 12-under hockey  team that plays in my district.

While on the way to the Western Girls Hockey League playoffs, a  snowplow collided head-on with one of their team vans, injuring five  players and killing Manny Lorenzana.

We remember Manny as a loving dad to Brody, an excellent partner to  April, and a talented tattoo artist.

After such a tragic event, the team rallied together and made the  decision all on their own to play on for Manny and for their injured  teammates. Amazingly, in the face of hardship that came far too early  for those so young, the Santa Clarita Flyers ended up taking home the  championship after a nail-biting final that ended 1-0 in overtime.

Here is what I want this amazing team and their families to know: The  entire Santa Clarita community has their back, and we are deeply proud  of them. I can't wait to cheer them all on at the next home game next  season.
