Removal of the Use of United States Forces for Hostilities Within or Against Venezuela


Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, no President, Democrat or Republican, can  declare war without Congress. Congress is the branch of government  vested with this solemn responsibility.

President Trump has not requested or received any authorization for  the use of military force against Venezuela. Yet he continues to  escalate the situation by striking speedboats, seizing oil tankers, and  establishing blockades, which is an act of war.

Congress must be consulted. The President is either trying to  distract Americans from the fact that millions of people are going to  lose their healthcare, or he believes that he is a king unbound by our  laws, unbound by international law, and unbound by our Constitution.

We cannot allow him to unilaterally declare war. Congress must be  consulted.

Vote ``yes'' on this resolution.
