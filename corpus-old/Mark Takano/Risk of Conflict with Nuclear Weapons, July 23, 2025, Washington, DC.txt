Risk of Conflict with Nuclear Weapons


Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, the ranking member of  the Rules Committee, Mr. McGovern, for yielding. I thank him and the  CPC for organizing this very important Special Order hour.

Next month marks 80 years since the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and  Nagasaki. These were the only times nuclear weapons have ever been used  in war.

I have to say that this memorial, this memory, this 80th anniversary  milestone is not just historical, it is somewhat personal and  unexpectedly so, say, beginning in 2001, 2002 when at the age of 40, 41  I made my first visit to Japan.

I grew up as an American, a Japanese American. One of my  grandparents, my only grandparent, my grandfather, Isao Takano,  immigrated to the United States around 1916. He was born in 1898 in  Japan, and he came from the environs of Hiroshima.

Growing up, we would go to his niece, my second cousin or I don't  know how to kind of appropriate the right sort of familial designation  of who is a cousin, a second cousin, but Kikue Takagi was my  grandfather's niece who married an American and lived in Anaheim and  worked at Disneyland.

We knew some facts, but we never in our times when we would get  together for our family gatherings would we ever discuss what happened  in Hiroshima. It wasn't until I was well into my adulthood on my first  trip to Japan visiting Hiroshima and visiting Kikue, who was there  taking care of her mother, that I learned that she was a ``survivor'';  ``Hibakusha,'' that is the Japanese word for survivor, of the atom  bomb.

She lived in the outskirts of Hiroshima. If you have been there, it  is mountainous. It is a place, a delta, with five different rivers  converging, and she lived in the outskirts. She was a middle school  student. On the day that the bomb dropped, she was still ill, so much  so that her mother said she didn't need to go into the city center to  do her public service work. The middle schoolchildren were needed to  clean up the debris of the area around the downtown of Hiroshima. They  were doing an urban renewal project to widen the streets.

They knew, the people of Hiroshima, the political class knew that  Hiroshima was a target because it was an industrial city. But little  did they know that the teachers, the middle schoolteachers and the 13- year-olds who were there at the city center doing this public service  work were all going to perish that day. My cousin survived because she  stayed home at the behest of her mother.

She had not visited any of the memorials until I had arrived in the  early 2000s. And I felt a tinge of guilt for asking her to do this  because she had never really sort of delved into this history by  visiting the memorial museum.

Riding over the bridge of one of the rivers to the museum the day  that Kikue and I decided to go, she told me about how the river was not  visible during the day that the bomb was dropped and the days afterward  because of the number of bodies that just covered the surface of that  water.

When you arrive at the memorial location, you can see bottles of  water that many people who attend these memorials will leave for the  thirsty souls of those who perished and those who were thirsty from the  August heat.

I feel a deep obligation and responsibility to carry this memory  forward. I remember as I crossed the bridge thinking to myself how I  was personally connected by family to this historical event, that it  was not something abstract. It was a moment that who I was, my  identity, somewhat shifted and changed.

More than 200,000 people were killed, most of them civilians. Some  died instantly. Others suffered for months or years from burns,  radiation, and grief.

Mr. Speaker, 80 years after the erasure of two cities we have still  not learned the lessons of these terrible bombings.

There are an estimated 13,400 nuclear warheads on Earth today. The  United States and Russia hold more than 90 percent of them. Together,  we control more than 12,000 warheads, and that is more than enough to  end human civilization. While the United States and Russia maintain the  largest stockpiles, China is rapidly building.

According to the Department of Defense, China's arsenal already has  500 operational warheads, and if current trends continue, it could  surpass 1,000 by the year 2030.

This growth adds to global instability and makes the case for urgent  diplomacy and arms control even stronger. Yet, the most important arms  control treaty still in force between the United States and Russia is  set to expire in less than 200 days.

If we let the New START Treaty expire, we will be left with no legal  limits on the size of the two largest nuclear arsenals in the world. At  the same time, we are seeing headlines about strikes on Iran's nuclear  facilities.

These actions revive a dangerous question: Can we stop the spread of  nuclear weapons through military force? I believe the answer is no. We  cannot destroy knowledge with a bomb. We cannot erase a nuclear program  by targeting one facility.

Strikes might delay a program, but they almost always provoke  retaliation and harden resolve. They do nothing to build the kind of  long-term trust and transparency that actually reduces nuclear risk.

That is why we need a strategy based on diplomacy, prevention, and  protection. We know that this strategy can work because it did in the  past. Iran's nuclear weapons program development ground to a halt under  the Iran nuclear deal. It was only after President Trump ripped up the  accord that Iran set itself on the pathway that it is on today.

The recent strikes reinforce the military theocracy's paranoia that  the only pathway to secure the regime's long-term survival is through  the development of a nuclear program. Like I said before, if a nation  has enough willpower and know-how, they will develop a nuclear weapon.  That means that the United States' national security cannot solely rest  on deterrence. We should lead by example.

That means modernizing verification tools, supporting the  international inspectors, and investing in the diplomatic capacity to  negotiate real agreements. It also means rethinking how we can make  decisions about the use of nuclear weapons.

Mr. Speaker, Congress has a role to play. We cannot stay silent while  the risks grow and the guardrails fall away. The American people  deserve transparency about how nuclear launch decisions are made and  who is involved in making them. This is not just a matter of policy. It  is a matter of survival.

Mr. Speaker, Hiroshima and Nagasaki were not mere tragedies. They  were warnings. The people who died there cannot speak for themselves,  but we can speak for the future they were denied. We can choose a path  that avoids repeating the worst mistake in human history.

Let us honor the lives lost not only with remembrance but with  responsibility. Let's choose diplomacy over destruction, prevention  over provocation, and peace over peril.

Let me return back to that scene of riding over that bridge over the  river with my cousin Kikue and the thought that I had that every world  leader who has some control over a nuclear arsenal should make a  commitment to visit Hiroshima, to walk the grounds and understand what  happened there and in Nagasaki. I think that is the only way that one  has the moral stature and authority to be a leader of a country that  has a nuclear arsenal.
