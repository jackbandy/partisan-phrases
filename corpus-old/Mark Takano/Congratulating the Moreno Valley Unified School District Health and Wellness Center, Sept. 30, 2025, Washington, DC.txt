Congratulating the Moreno Valley Unified School District Health and Wellness Center


Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Moreno Valley  Unified School District for the opening of its new Health and Wellness  Center, and to commend the district's leadership for their unwavering  commitment to supporting students and families in need.

Last week, I had the honor of attending the ribbon-cutting ceremony  for this Center, which will serve as a vital resource for students and  their families who are experiencing homelessness, financial hardship,  or foster care. Through the Department of Wellness, Mental Health, and  Community Outreach, the Health and Wellness Center provides wraparound  support to ensure that students can succeed both in and out of the  classroom.

The Center offers a wide range of services, including washer and  dryer access, showers, preventive dental care, eyeglasses, a food  pantry, a clothing closet, tutoring, and more. It also provides  emergency short-term housing and works with partners to connect  students with youth specialists. These resources restore dignity and  stability, ensuring that every student has the opportunity to thrive.

I want to especially recognize Superintendent Dr. Alejandro Ruvalcaba  for his outstanding leadership in overseeing this project. His  dedication, and the dedication of the entire district, has made this  Center a reality and reflects Moreno Valley Unifier's belief that  education is not just about academics--it is about providing students  with the foundation they need to build a brighter future.

Mr. Speaker, the opening of the Health and Wellness Center is a  potent example of how schools can serve as hubs of hope and  opportunity. I commend Moreno Valley Unified School District for their  vision and commitment, and I am confident that this Center will have a  lasting impact on the lives of many students and families in our  community.
