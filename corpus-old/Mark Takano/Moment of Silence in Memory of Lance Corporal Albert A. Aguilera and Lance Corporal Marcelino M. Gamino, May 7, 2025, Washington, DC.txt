Moment of Silence in Memory of Lance Corporal Albert A. Aguilera and Lance Corporal Marcelino M. Gamino


Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, we gather on the floor of the House of  Representatives to pay tribute to two United States marines who died in  service to our Nation. Lance Corporal Albert A. Aguilera of Riverside  and Lance Corporal Marcelino M. Gamino of Fresno were both killed in a  tragic vehicle accident while on deployment as part of Joint Task  Force-Southern Border.

Both were combat engineers with the 1st Marine Division at Camp  Pendleton, and both were far too young to be taken from their families,  friends, and fellow marines.

It is a terrible grief that these families now carry, and it is  incumbent on all of us as a Nation to remember the sacrifice of these  young men.

I ask all my colleagues to join us in a moment of silence in memory  of Lance Corporal Aguilera and Lance Corporal Gamino.
