Tariffs Lead to Highest Sales Tax on Americans in History


Mr. LANDSMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because this administration,  the folks who are in charge of this country, after promising lower  prices and a better economy, are actively jacking up prices and tanking  the economy.

Last year in Ohio, we imported $86 billion in goods. Now, nearly  every country in the entire world is dealing with these tariffs because  of a trade war that no one but one man wanted. The price of all of this  will fall on us.

It is a tax on nearly everything we buy, everything we sell.  Americans have watched their hard-earned savings vanish as the markets  have tanked every day since the announcement.

Trump has now unilaterally placed the highest sales tax on Americans  in the history of this country.

The impact? Higher prices across the board. The average family is  expected to pay an extra $4,000 this year alone. They cannot afford  that.

Trump says: ``I couldn't care less.''

Mr. Speaker, we need to end this chaos.
