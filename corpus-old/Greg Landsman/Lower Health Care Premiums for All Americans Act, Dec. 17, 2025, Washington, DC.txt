Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act


Mr. LANDSMAN. Mr. Speaker, of the 22 million Americans who rely on  the Affordable Care Act subsidies, 32,000 live in my district. They are  about to experience healthcare costs that are skyrocketing. They want  one thing, that is it, Mr. Speaker. They want one thing. They want us  to extend the Affordable Care Act subsidies. Eighty percent of  Americans have said this is what they want. These are farmers, small  businesses, and families. If they were in this Chamber today, they  would point to the well and say: There are 218 signatures on this  discharge petition. Just put it on the floor, vote for it, and give us  the subsidies that help us pay for our healthcare.
