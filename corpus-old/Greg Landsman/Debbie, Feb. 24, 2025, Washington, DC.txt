Debbie, Va Employee


Mr. LANDSMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of one of my  constituents, Debbie. Up until 1 week ago, Debbie worked at the  Cincinnati VA, responsible for finding and hiring doctors with the  skills needed to treat very sick veterans.

Debbie loved her job, she was good at her job, and she went to work  every day to serve her community and to help our veterans. A week ago,  Debbie received an email telling her she no longer had a job. She  wasn't fired because veterans were suddenly cured or because her work  was no longer needed. Donald Trump and his unelected tech billionaire,  Elon Musk, fired Debbie and slashed services at VA facilities  nationwide making it harder for millions of veterans to get the  services they need.

It is simply wrong. Our veterans deserve better. Debbie and her  family deserve better, and we need Republican Members of Congress who  control this body to stand up for our veterans and our public servants  and stop this madness.
