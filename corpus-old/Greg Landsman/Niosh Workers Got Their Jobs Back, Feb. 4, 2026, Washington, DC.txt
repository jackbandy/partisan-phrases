Niosh Workers Got Their Jobs Back


Mr. LANDSMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of all the NIOSH  workers around the country, including the 400 in my district. For 50  years, NIOSH has been helping workers all over the country, making sure  that workers are safe and healthy.

During all the DOGE cuts, 1,500 NIOSH workers lost their jobs. We got  to work. We worked with labor and others, and 100 Members of Congress,  and we started getting those jobs reinstated.

We asked Secretary Kennedy to work with us to make sure that every  single one of these workers got their jobs back. Just a few weeks ago,  we found out that every one of them did get their jobs back.

I thank the NIOSH folks for their ongoing support, for everyone in  labor for working with us, and for the work of this Congress to stand  up for workers, especially my colleagues over here.
