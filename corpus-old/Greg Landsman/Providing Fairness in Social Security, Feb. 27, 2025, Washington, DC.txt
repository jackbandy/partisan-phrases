Providing Fairness in Social Security


Mr. LANDSMAN. Mr. Speaker, the Social Security Fairness Act, which we  passed a few months ago, is now in effect, and 3.2 million Americans  will see a big increase in their monthly Social Security checks.

We are talking about retired public schoolteachers, retired police  officers, retired firefighters, and retired letter carriers. They paid  into Social Security for years but weren't getting their full benefits.  They were missing out on hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars a  month.

The bill was introduced in every Congress for the last 25 years. It  had the most bipartisan support of any bill in the last Congress.

We had to force a vote on the bill with a discharge petition, and  within 2 days, we got 218 signatures. We fought very hard to get this  done, and now, our public retirees will finally start to see the  benefits they were owed each month.

We could not have done this without the advocacy of thousands of  public servants and retirees. I hope it can help restore some faith in  our government that this institution does still get things done.
