Planned Parenthood


Mr. LANDSMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the girls and  women in my district who just lost access to their healthcare because  of this budget bill.

Just weeks after this bill passed, two Planned Parenthood clinics in  southwest Ohio are closing. These are clinics thousands of girls and  women rely on for things like cancer screenings and contraceptive care,  their basic healthcare.

It is a direct attack on women, and it is just the start. Millions  and millions of Americans will lose their healthcare. In the end, more  than 15 million people could be left without care, all to pay for tax  cuts for millionaires, billionaires, and big corporations.

All it takes is a Congress that it is willing to make the wealthiest  in America pay their taxes like the rest of us and give those 15  million Americans their healthcare back. It is that simple.
