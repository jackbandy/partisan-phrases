Plain Language in Contracting Act


Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, Representatives LaLota and Tran,  for their work on this legislation.

Mr. Speaker, the complexity of the government's procurement process  and requirements can be overwhelming to small businesses, including  those seeking a Federal contract for the first time.

This government-speak, words we only find in government contracting  documents like requests for proposals or solicitations, compound the  complexity and may disincentivize firms from bidding.

This bill attempts to add clarity by requiring documents to be  written in a plain way that helps firms more easily understand what the  government is buying.

Small firms should not be put off from working with the government  because available opportunities are not communicated clearly. We need  more small businesses to bring their talent and innovation into Federal  agencies, and I am hopeful this bill will contribute to that effort.

Mr. Speaker, we will put this in really plain words, since that is  what the bill does. Small businesses need to be able to understand what  is happening in these contracts. Having language that is easy to  understand will enable them to apply for these contracts, which enables  them to bring their talents and their innovation to bear in our Federal  Government.

Over the last decade, small businesses have been leaving at an  alarming rate. Nothing we are doing is working to reverse that trend.  In fact, the number of small business vendors in the government's  ecosystem has been cut nearly in half.

Having this bill will make it easier for small business owners,  people who are already working around the clock, to make their business  successful for themselves, their communities, and their employees. They  will now have an easier chance of applying for a contract with the  Federal Government.

I am hopeful when this legislation is implemented, it will contribute  to that goal. I thank the bill's sponsors.
