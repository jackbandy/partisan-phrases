Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025


Mr. McGARVEY. Mr. Speaker, I can tell you exactly what is going on in  Louisville, Kentucky, right now. Grocery prices are up, and retirement  savings are in chaos.

Republicans could put an end to this crisis, but instead, they are  going to make things worse.

Republicans are about to hand billionaires like Elon Musk $5.3  trillion in tax cuts, the biggest billionaire tax cut in American  history. To pay for it, Republicans are cutting health insurance for  families; ripping away food from kids, seniors, and veterans; and  cutting public education, all while increasing the national debt by $5  trillion.

I don't ever want to hear a Republican complain about the debt again  because no matter how they try to cook the books--believe me, they are  doing that, too--they cannot hide from the negative impact this budget  will have.

Seniors will lose healthcare coverage. Veterans will lose coverage  for the medications they need. Kids will go hungry. For what? So Elon  Musk pays even less in taxes? It is reckless and it is wrong.
