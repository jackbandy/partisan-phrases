Congratulating Geraldine ``bubby'' Litvin Shaffer on Her 100th Birthday


Mr. McGARVEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  extraordinary life and centennial milestone of Geraldine ``Bubby''  Litvin Shaffer, who celebrates her 100th birthday on October 28, 2025.

Born in 1925, Geraldine has lived a life centered on faith, service,  and love for her family. Together with her beloved husband, Louis  Shlomo Leib Litvin, she raised five children, and today, she is the  proud grandmother to over 100 grandchildren and great-grandchildren,  including Jewish leaders in America, Cyprus, and Israel.

Geraldine's devotion to her family is equaled only by her commitment  to her community. In Boston, she distinguished herself as both an  entrepreneur and education activist. While running a shoe store, she  also headed the board of a Jewish school, working tirelessly for its  success. In recent years, she has made her home in Kentucky, where she  became a matriarch for her entire community. Known for her kindness and  generosity, she volunteers her time and reaches out to all with warmth  and care. She is a dedicated student of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi  Menachem Mendel Schneerson, and is a devout Jew and incredibly proud  American.

Mr. Speaker, Geraldine ``Bubby'' Litvin Shaffer's century of life  stands as a remarkable testament to her resilience, faith, and love for  others. I ask my esteemed colleagues in the United States House of  Representatives to please join me in celebrating her 100th birthday and  wishing her continued joy surrounded by family and community.
