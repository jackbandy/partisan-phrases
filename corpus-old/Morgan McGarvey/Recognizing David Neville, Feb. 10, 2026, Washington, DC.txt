Recognizing David Neville


Mr. McGARVEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize David Neville,  owner of Capstone Farms in Kentucky, for receiving the prestigious 2026  Citizen Diplomat Award.

On 258 acres of land in Northern Kentucky, David has built not just a  farm, but a laboratory of ingenuity. Through hydroponic and aquaponic  growing systems, sustainable land management practices like using goats  to clear brush, and a deep commitment to mentorship, he is helping pave  the way for Kentucky farmers and farmers worldwide to build stronger,  more resilient farms. His work reflects the creativity and  resourcefulness that define the American spirit and helps keep our  farming economy strong, innovative, and ready for the challenges ahead.

David embodies the spirit of hospitality that Kentuckians everywhere  extend to our neighbors. David has opened his farm to more than 450  participants in the U.S. Department of State's International Visitor  Leadership Program from over 100 countries to learn from his practices  and spark ideas they can carry back home.

Kentucky is proud to call Mr. Neville one of our own, and I am  honored to recognize his remarkable contributions to our home and the  world. I once again congratulate him on receiving the Citizen Diplomat  Award and wish him the best in his future work.
