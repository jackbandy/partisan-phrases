One Big Beautiful Bill Act


Mr. McGARVEY. Mr. Speaker, a budget is a series of choices.  Republicans are choosing to take healthcare away from 17 million  Americans. Republicans are choosing to take food off the plates of  hardworking families, kids, and seniors. Republicans are choosing to  blow up the national debt by trillions of dollars. For what? All so the  top 0.1 percent can pay even less in taxes.

I don't ever want to hear a Republican say they care about rural  America or the debt ever again if they vote for this bill. A budget is  a series of choices and theirs are indefensible.

I will vote ``no.''
