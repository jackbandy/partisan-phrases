Energy and Water Cuts


Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, moments ago in this Chamber, a very  important piece of legislation was passed by one vote. It was the  appropriation bill for energy and water.

We would do well to understand what was actually in that bill: money  to deal with the climate, removed; money to deal with new energy  sources, renewable energy sources, removed; energy efficiency, removed.

Where did the money go? It went into nuclear weapons programs, the  Sentinel program. Over $200 billion will be spent replacing the  Minuteman III missile. Why? Why are we doing that? Why are we putting  more money into plutonium pit production? Why do we have a new useless  rocket that we want to put on a submarine? Why are we doing that?

On the water side of this, the Army Corps of Engineers, money was  removed for flood protection, levies, and infrastructure around the  Nation.

We would do well to understand the values of the Republicans who  voted for this and the Democrats. We are looking to the future, and the  Republicans are looking to the past.
