Make State Wildlife Action Plans Efficient Act of 2025


Mr. DONALDS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of my bill,  H.R. 1676, the Make SWAPs Efficient Act.

This year marks the 20th anniversary of State Wildlife Action Plans,  a major milestone for fish and wildlife conservation. Statewide action  plans serve as a vital blueprint for identifying the unique  conservation needs of each State and territory and are required for  States to take part in the State and Tribal Wildlife Grant program.

These plans play a leading role in helping to prevent and recover  endangered species and guide the conservation of over 12,000 species in  the greatest conservation need.

Currently, there is no deadline for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service to approve a State-submitted wildlife action plan, with most  taking over 18 months to simply get an approval. This is something that  is unacceptable, and my legislation seeks to change that.

The bill directs the Secretary of the Interior to approve a State's  SWAP within 180 days, once the Secretary determines the SWAP complies  with the requirements of the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration  Act. If the Department of the Interior fails to authorize the SWAP  within 180 days, the SWAP is deemed approved.

It is time to take a real swipe to unnecessary red tape, minimize  self-induced delays, and streamline the regulatory process for the  allocation of much-needed conservation funding to our States.

Mr. Speaker, this is a very good piece of legislation. It was my  pleasure to work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle on this. I  recommend that the body approve this legislation.
