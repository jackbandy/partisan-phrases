Recognizing Associated Builders Contractors Institute Apprenticeship College's 50th Anniversary Celebration


Mr. MOSKOWITZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Associated  Builders & Contractors Institute Apprenticeship College (ABCI) on the  event of its 50th anniversary. A proud institution in Florida's 23rd  Congressional District, ABCI provides apprenticeship training for the  construction industry across our region. They collaborate directly with  builders, contractors, and educators for a quality, hands-on  apprenticeship education and construction trade program that helps  drive our economy from South Florida all the way up Florida's Eastern  coast.

We're particularly proud that ABCI has become the largest single  provider of apprenticeship education and training in the state of  Florida. It is a leader in innovative apprenticeship programs for the  construction workforce--including in some of the most high-demand  areas of trade and it has set up its students for success with access  to employment opportunities even before they complete their education.

The more than 900 pre-apprentices and apprentices currently enrolled  in the Institute are a testament to ABCI's reach, as are the many  students that have come before and the many that will come after. As  Florida continues to grow, ABCI and its students will continue to help  meet the ever-growing needs of the construction sector.

Mr. Speaker, as we commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the Associated  Builders & Contractors Institute Apprenticeship College, I ask my  colleagues to join me in celebrating ABCI, its leadership, and its  dedication to supporting Florida's workforce. The dedication, skill,  and expertise of their many graduates are a testament to the success  they've had over these past 50 years and will continue to have many  years into the future.
