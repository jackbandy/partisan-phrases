Recognizing the 2025 Honorees of the Broward County, Florida Senior Hall of Fame


Mr. MOSKOWITZ. Mr. Speaker, I along with my colleagues,  Representative Wasserman Schultz and Representative Cherfilus-McCormick  rise today to highlight and celebrate the 2025 Honorees of the Senior  Hall of Fame, an esteemed tradition made possible through the tireless  efforts of the Area Agency on Aging of Broward County, a cornerstone  organization dedicated to enhancing the quality of life for older  adults in our community.

The Area Agency on Aging of Broward County is part of a vital  statewide network of 11 Area Agencies on Aging across Florida. These  agencies are tasked with coordinating a wide array of programs and  services designed to help seniors live safely, independently, and with  dignity in their own homes and communities. From meal delivery and  transportation assistance to caregiver support and health education,  the Agency plays a pivotal role in addressing the needs of our aging  population.

Each year, the Broward Senior Hall of Fame honors exemplary residents  aged 60 and older who have selflessly dedicated five or more years to  volunteer service in Broward County. These individuals embody the  spirit of civic engagement and community service that strengthens the  social fabric of our region.

This year's distinguished honorees are Linda Hill Anderson, Sandra  Atkins, Timothy G. Curtin, Barbara Effman, Helena Friedman, Susan  Gilbert, Juanita Gray, Mona Malbranche, Melinda Montgomery, Dr. Irving  Rosenbaum, Zeff Ross, Reverend Jesse Scipio, and Doris Tarlow. Their  contributions have made a meaningful difference--from mentoring youth  and supporting local nonprofits to improving access to healthcare and  advocating for vulnerable residents. Their efforts are not only  commendable but inspiring.

We would also like to offer a special thank you to Charlotte Mather- Taylor, CEO of the Area Agency on Aging of Broward County, whose  visionary leadership and deep commitment to service have elevated the  Agency's impact throughout our community. Her dedication ensures that  our seniors continue to receive the respect, support, and recognition  they deserve.

Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Florida's 20th, 23rd and 25th Congressional  Districts, we ask our colleagues to join us in congratulating these  outstanding individuals for their extraordinary volunteerism and in  recognizing the indispensable role the Area Agency on Aging of Broward  County plays in honoring and serving our older citizens.
