Recognizing Tom Kiesla


Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to celebrate my good friend,  Tom Kiesla, who is retiring from a long career in the City of Orange.

Tom started in 1986 as a reserve police officer with the Orange  Police Department. He worked his way up to officer, sergeant,  lieutenant, and then chief of police.

Tom retired from the Orange Police Department in 2021 and was then  appointed to become the interim city manager for the City of Orange.  Under his leadership, the city's economy boomed and community outreach  grew.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Tom for always being there for the citizens, for  the community of the City of Orange. I congratulate him on a well- deserved retirement, and I look forward to seeing the next chapter in  his life.

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Tom.
