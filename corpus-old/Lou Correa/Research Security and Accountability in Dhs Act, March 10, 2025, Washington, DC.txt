Research Security and Accountability in Dhs Act


Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 901, the Research Security and  Accountability in DHS Act. This bill seeks to enhance security measures  by directing the Department of Homeland Security's Science and  Technology Directorate to establish a comprehensive policy and process  to protect research and development activities from unauthorized access  or disclosure of sensitive information.

Additionally, this bill would task the Government Accountability  Office to assess DHS' adherence to the National Science and Technology  Council's 2022 implementation guidance and a 2021 National Security  Presidential Memorandum focused on safeguarding U.S. research from  foreign interference.

This bill also requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to provide  Congress with a briefing on its implementation.

Time and time again, we have seen bad actors attempt to exploit our  sensitive information. This measure strengthens DHS' ability to prevent  such threats and protects our national security.

This bill is a critical step in ensuring DHS upholds strong policies  and procedures to secure research and development efforts.

Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R.

Mr. Speaker, the passage of this legislation is a key step in  protecting DHS' research and development capabilities from bad actors.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 901, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
