Wake-Up Call for Immigration Reform


Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to once again stress the need  for immigration reform in this country.

Just last week, back home, one of my taxpaying constituents, Narciso  Barranco, was picked up by who I believe were ICE agents--they were  masked--and is now sitting in an ICE holding facility in Los Angeles.  Videos show him being punched by masked Federal agents, unprovoked.

Narciso Barranco has lived in my district for 25 years or more and  doesn't have a traffic ticket to his name. More importantly, he has  three sons--three sons--all serving in the U.S. Marine Corps.

Mr. Speaker, we make movies about families like this. He has three  sons who are ready to make the ultimate sacrifice for this great  Nation, and, instead, he is being held in custody in an ICE facility in  Los Angeles.

Our Federal agents should be taking criminals off of our streets, not  gentlemen like this.

I pray that Mr. Barranco's case is a wake-up call for all of us for  immigration reform.
