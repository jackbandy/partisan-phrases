Recognizing Mr. Bharat Patel for His Contributions to Our Orange County Community


Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Bharat Patel  for his incredible career and contributions to our community.

In 1976, the Patel Family acquired the original Peter Pan Motor  Lodge, located right across the street from Disneyland, and began  renovating and expanding it to its current size. Almost 50 years later,  Mr. Patel's leadership has helped transform this small business into  Castle Inn & Suites, a true Anaheim staple. This charming hotel has  become a popular destination for vacationing families, and is known for  its castle theme, friendly staff, and Mr. Patel's own personal customer  service as its owner-operator.

Mr. Patel is much more than a business leader; he is an active  philanthropist and sits on the boards of Whittier College, California  Lodging Industry Association, Visit Anaheim, Anaheim Transportation  Network, and Chapman University. Mr. Patel is much more than a local  business leader; he is an active philanthropist and a homegrown product  of our community. A fellow California State University, Fullerton,  alumni, he shows his dedication to our community through his work with  the Anaheim Family YMCA and Anaheim Police Association.

I call on my colleagues to join me in recognizing Mr. Patel for the  positive change he has helped create in Anaheim and Orange County, and  congratulating him on being honored by Cypress College's Americana  Awards as Citizen of the Year.

Our community is grateful to Mr. Patel for his leadership and  contributions. I thank him for his steadfast support for our hometown-- these honors are well-deserved.
