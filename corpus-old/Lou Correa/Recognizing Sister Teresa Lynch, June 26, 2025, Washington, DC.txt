Recognizing Sister Teresa Lynch


Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Sister Teresa Lynch, who  will be retiring from Santa Ana's Saint Anne School.

She served as a teacher for 31 years and principal for 19 years at  Saint Genevieve and Saint Anne School. She also worked to improve the  lives of incarcerated prisoners at the California Institute for Women  in Chino, California. She also co-directed the Get on the Bus program  that connected children with their incarcerated parents.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Sister Teresa for showing us all what it means  to care for the community. I thank her for her friendship.

I congratulate Sister Teresa on her retirement. I suspect now, as a  retiree, she will be busier than ever.
