Strategic Homeland Intelligence and Enforcement Legislation to Defend Against the Ccp Act


Mr. Speaker, I think we all agree that the United States' main  competitor is China and the Chinese Communist Party who are intent on  tilting the global playing field to their benefit, undermining our  national standing.

To do this, China is expanding its covert influence, seeking to turn  public opinion and effect policies that are more favorable to China and  against the United States. Additionally, the CCP seeks to exploit  American openness to steal economic secrets and undermine our national  security.

This bill would require the Department of Homeland Security to  establish a working group to coordinate its efforts to address the  threats posed to the homeland by the Chinese Communist Party.

The working group will examine the threats posed by the CCP, identify  ongoing Departmental efforts to address those threats, identify any  gaps in such efforts, and then facilitate coordination across DHS to  holistically address the threats from the CCP.

Mr. Speaker, this bill helps ensure that DHS implements a coordinated  and effective response to the Chinese Communist Party's efforts to  undermine the United States.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Strong for sponsoring this  legislation,  but I must acknowledge that over the past few weeks, the Trump  administration has taken several alarming actions that work to counter  the work we are trying to do today with this legislation.

Mr. Speaker, I urge the Trump administration to work with Congress  and not against Congress' efforts to strengthen America's ability to  compete with China like this bill that aims to do exactly that.

Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
