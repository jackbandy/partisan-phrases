Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, this past week, I had the honor to visit a  number of senior centers in my district. I saw seniors having a meal at  lunchtime paid for by SNAP, seniors that have relied on Social  Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and SNAP, seniors that have worked all  their lives to build America, and all they want to do is have a  peaceful retirement.

I rise today because my colleagues across the aisle are looking to  cut Medicaid and SNAP, programs that hundreds of millions of Americans  rely on to keep food on their table and their families healthy.

My colleagues are targeting almost $900 billion in cuts to Medicaid,  threatening to take away healthcare for some 80 million Americans who  rely on this program. That would strip away healthcare from millions,  including children, seniors, people with disabilities, and veterans.

They are targeting SNAP, a vital food assistance program that  provides food to 40 million people: seniors, children, and veterans.

I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so that we can  bring up H.R. 2753, the Hands Off Medicaid and SNAP Act, to stop our  colleagues from taking away healthcare from Americans and making a big  mistake.
