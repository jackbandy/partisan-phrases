Stock Trading Ban for Members of Congress


Mr. BRESNAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  effort to ban congressional stock trading because public service must  never be compromised by private financial interest. The American people  deserve to know that we are acting on their behalf, not for our own  portfolios.

That is why I have already begun placing all of my assets into a  blind trust, to align my conduct with the principles behind this  important reform.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives Roy and Magaziner for their  bipartisan leadership on this issue. Their work demonstrates the kind  of accountability and integrity that Congress needs more of. Their  efforts are a critical step forward toward rebuilding trust in our  institutions, and I look forward to working with them to codify this  into law.
